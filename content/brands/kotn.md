For Lasting Ways of LifeA world of timeless designs that honour the people who make them and the places they’re made.Kotn started with a simple—and in retrospect, naive—goal to create the perfect t-shirt. A shirt that didn’t compromise on quality, price, or the integrity of the people who made it. Today, we’re a certified B Corporation voted Best for the World™, with the fourth-highest B Impact Score of apparel brands in North America. With each order, we invest in the creation of jobs, infrastructure, systems, and education to alleviate poverty and create shared, sustainable growth for the communities we are part of.Video by Adrian AssoufiThe idea for Kotn was dreamt up during a hot New York summer by three friends, our Co-founders, Ben, Mackenzie, and Rami. Spurred on by the thought, Rami took a trip back to his familial home of Egypt where he found himself living in a cotton-farming community in the Nile Delta for six months. There, the first real seed of Kotn was planted.
