Kerr’s was founded in 1895 by brothers Edward and Albert Kerr. After emigrating from Scotland, they opened a candy shop in St. Thomas, Ontario. Known for its quality and rich heritage, Kerr’s is an industry leader in Canadian confectionery. Today, Kerr’s products are still manufactured in Ontario at the head office in Oakville. Our team focuses on creating candy suitable for all Canadians. The Kerr’s factory is peanut free, tree-nut free and gluten free. We also produce many products that are suitable for kosher or halal diets, as well as sugar reduced diets.
