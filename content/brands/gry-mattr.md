ABOUT US At gry mattr we believe that our mindset directly impacts how we experience the present moment: what we do, what we create, how we relate to others, how we spend our time, where we want to go, and how we get there.Our collection of blue light glasses hopes to inspire you to see the world through a different lens. Rather than seeing an obstacle that deters you from striving forward, we hope you see the possibilities that lay ahead as dreams waiting to be brought to life.We know our eyes are powerful tools, ones we feel inspired to protect, for they allow us to envision a better future, a better world, and a better way forward if we only have the clarity to see it.
