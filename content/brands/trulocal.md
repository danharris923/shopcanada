Building Canada’s Regional Supply Chains truLOCAL is more than just a box of (delicious) meat. It's the community we've built, the producers we work with, the members of our team, and the journey along the way. The truLOCAL marketplace is an online shop where you can support your local economy by browsing for meat products from farmers, producers and butchers within your province.
