OUR HISTORYMasters of the Grill since 1979.We are a blend of taste, culture and community. Our founder, Reverend Susumu Ikuta, came from Japan to Canada to share a life full of faith and community. He opened Edo Japan over 45 years ago as a means for both nourishing and providing for the community. This inclusive philosophy is at the core of our company of franchisees to this day.TIMELINEFRESH FACTSOUR COMMUNITYLet's be great neighbours together.At Edo Japan we honour our roots by supporting community beyond our restaurants. It has us putting people first through donations and event volunteering. Since 2010, we’ve been a proud supporter of food banks across Canada, caring, connecting and helping to reduce hunger at the local level year after year.SUPPORTINGENRICHINGNOURISHINGOrder NowAbout Us
