What’s the deal?As former athletes, our co-founders Amar Gupta and Josh Barr struggled to find a simple protein drink that could help them recover between training sessions – let alone one that tasted good. Everything on the market was the same: full of calories, complex ingredients, and chalky taste.So, they developed brüst – a protein drink that’s made from high quality ingredients and delivers on great taste. brüst is simply a protein packed cold brew coffee that was crafted to help athletes power through their day and fuel up while on the go.
