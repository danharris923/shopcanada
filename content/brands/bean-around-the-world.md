Our Story We’ve been around for a while, and that’s a good thing The Bean was born in an era when we still listened to cassettes in our cafés. More importantly, it was also the era of Vancouver’s “second-wave” coffee boom. West Coast coffee culture is thriving, but it’s also relatively new – since we opened our flagship store in West Vancouver during B.C.’s coffee awakening in the ‘90s, we like to think we’re among “the originals”. We’re about good people and good coffee Since the beginning, we sought out the best beans and the best people that the coffee industry had to offer. People seem to appreciate that, and we’ve been growing ever since. In 1994, we opened up our roastery, which allowed us to provide that iconic Bean Around the World taste to an increasing number of shops. We’ve now got 23 locations around the Lower Mainland and a bounty of loyal coffee subscribers who get their beans by delivery.
