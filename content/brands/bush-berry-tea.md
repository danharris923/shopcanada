Our forward-thinking approach to packaging is a testament to our commitment to sustainability. We have eliminated all plastics from our packaging and shipping, and our 100% backyard compostable materials are leading the way in the disposable packaging industry. We strive to be more responsible and want our products, branding, and packaging to reflect that. As a small, Canadaian, female-owned, independent business, we're proud to craft tea blends that reflect our commitment to clean, fair, and healthy living. When you choose Bush Berry, you're not just enjoying a cup of tea—you’re supporting a movement for sustainability, thoughtful sourcing, and mindful living. Thank you for being part of our journey. Together, let's create a more sustainable future, one cup at a time.-Christine Riediger, Founder114 2nd Ave NW Nakusp, BC EMAIL | info@bushberry.ca@bush.berry.tea
