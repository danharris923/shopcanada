THE CAFÉ IS THE PEOPLE'S PARLIAMENT -HONORÉ DE BALZAC Inspired by the Grand Cafés of Paris, Balzac's Coffee Roasters was brought to life by a burning ambition to bring that culture to Canada. Starting as a coffee cart in 1993, we opened our first café in Stratford, Ontario in 1996. Since then, we have grown to 16 distinct locations and can be found on the shelves of grocery stores across the country.Find A Café What distinguishes Balzac's, aside from unrivalled roasts and formidable female leadership, is that every café is specifically designed to embody the cultural nuances and historical significance of the location it's in. In doing so, each café has carved out a unique personality as a central gathering place for locals. People come to a Balzac’s café to converse and debate, to fall in love and create. And the fact that all Balzac's cafés have garnered quite the loyal following proves that providing a place for people to drink excellent coffee in the authentic French tradition has an appeal that can only be described as everlasting.
