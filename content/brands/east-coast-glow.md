Hello and welcome. We’re Karen and Roger Dewling, founders of East Coast Glow, a wildcrafted skincare company located in amazing Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. We began this adventure in 2010 as two creatively minded (and somewhat frustrated) parents searching for a natural solution to our newborn daughter’s agonizing skin condition. Today, our modern apothecary studio and shop sits near the edge of the North Atlantic Ocean where ancient icebergs drift by each spring, offering us the purest water on the planet to use in our distillations. We’re passionate ambassadors for sustainable, plant-based skincare. We forage and harvest by hand, using only wild, sustainable ingredients. From river mint to wild rose, we embrace the seasons and the bounty each has to offer. We capture the synergy of nature with innovative formulas that blend ancient and modern science. We invite you to join us in a simple, unhurried, self-care ritual that delights the senses. – Karen + Roger
