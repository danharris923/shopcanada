We graze like deer when harvesting. Plants and this land have been sung to for generations from those who are from this land, and now each of us need to learn again to sing songs of thanks, the way all our ancestors have done. It reconnects us like a tree spreading deep tap roots, and ‘turns on’ dormant knowing. It is a returning home, to sink your feet, hands and heart into the earth… and listen to a great telling of our own remembering.
