# Old Navy Canada

## Deal Page Content Block (300-500 words)

Old Navy operates over 100 stores across Canada and has been part of the retail landscape since opening its first 12 Canadian locations in Ontario in 2001. The retailer specializes in affordable everyday clothing for women, men, kids, and babies, with extended sizes available across most categories.

Canadian shoppers often choose Old Navy for family clothing at accessible price points. The brand positions itself between discount and mid-tier pricing, making it practical for households outfitting multiple family members at once. Denim, basic layering pieces, activewear, and seasonal collections make up the core product range.

The [Navyist Rewards program](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/info.do?cid=1095422) operates on a simple points system with no annual fee. Members earn 1 point per dollar spent across Gap Inc.'s family of brands, with every 100 points converting to a $1 discount. Free shipping applies to orders over $50, with Icon-tier members (those spending $1,000 annually) qualifying at a $35 threshold instead. The program includes tiered benefits, with higher-spending members receiving perks like birthday bonuses and the ability to select a personal 15% off sale day once per year.

[Returns can be processed](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/customerService/info.do?cid=3325) either by mail or in-store within 30 days of purchase. The online return process generates prepaid shipping labels through UPS or Canada Post, and in-store returns require either the shipping confirmation or the card used for purchase. Gift returns receive an Options gift card valid across Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Old Navy locations.

Old Navy runs frequent promotional periods throughout the year. Weekly and seasonal sales are common, with the deepest discounts typically appearing during Black Friday, Boxing Week, back-to-school season, and mid-season clearance events. Super Cash promotions allow shoppers to earn discount codes based on spending thresholds, which can be redeemed during designated windows. Stacking loyalty points with sale pricing and Super Cash offers is a common savings strategy for regular customers.

The brand's focus on volume and family-oriented value means shoppers often purchase multiple items per visit. This approach works well for parents, budget-conscious shoppers, and those prioritizing function over premium fabrics or construction.

### What This Brand Means to Canadian Shoppers

Old Navy serves as a go-to source for affordable family clothing in Canada, particularly for households managing multiple clothing budgets at once. The brand's strength lies in accessible pricing on everyday basics, denim, activewear, and seasonal pieces across all age groups and extended sizes. For many Canadian families, Old Navy represents a practical middle ground between discount retailers and higher-priced mall brands, offering acceptable quality at prices that make sense when outfitting children who outgrow clothing quickly or adults who need workplace-appropriate basics without premium costs.

The retailer maintains over 100 locations across Canadian provinces, concentrated in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec, with additional presence in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and other regions. Online shopping at [oldnavy.gapcanada.ca](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca) extends access to communities without nearby physical stores, though delivery times to remote areas can stretch to two weeks.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

Old Navy launched in San Francisco in 1994 as a value-focused division of Gap Inc., designed to offer lower price points than the parent brand while maintaining broader market appeal. The concept proved successful quickly—Old Navy became the first retailer to surpass $1 billion in sales within its first four years and reached 500 stores by 2000.

Canada became the brand's first international market in 2001, when Old Navy opened 12 stores in Ontario. This marked a significant expansion test for the company, and the Canadian market responded positively. By 2004, the majority of Old Navy's growth was happening in Canada, where the store count had reached 33 locations. The expansion continued steadily over the following decade, with the company announcing plans in 2017 to reach 100 Canadian stores by 2020—a goal that reflected strong performance north of the border.

Gap Inc. continues to own and operate Old Navy as part of its portfolio alongside Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta. The shared ownership structure allows for cross-brand loyalty programs and integrated store operations, though each brand maintains distinct positioning and target demographics.

### Why Canadians Choose This Brand

Canadian shoppers gravitate toward Old Navy primarily for value-oriented family clothing. The brand's sizing range includes women's regular and plus sizes, men's regular and big & tall options, and children's sizing from newborn through teen years. This range makes it possible to complete household clothing needs in a single shopping trip, which appeals to parents managing time and budget constraints simultaneously.

Denim represents a particular strength for the retailer. Old Navy offers jeans at price points significantly below premium denim brands while providing multiple fits, rises, and washes across age groups and genders. Basic layering pieces—graphic tees, fleece, leggings, and casual button-downs—form another core category that sees consistent purchase patterns.

Seasonal clothing arrives in predictable cycles, allowing shoppers to anticipate new inventory for back-to-school, holiday gifting, summer vacation, and transitional weather. The brand leans toward trend-adjacent rather than trend-leading designs, which reduces pricing while still reflecting current style preferences in color palettes, silhouettes, and pattern choices.

Location accessibility plays a role as well. Old Navy stores typically operate in high-traffic retail centres and shopping malls with ample parking, making them convenient for families shopping with children. Store layouts organize merchandise by demographic (women's, men's, kids, baby) rather than by style category, which simplifies navigation for multi-generational shopping.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

The [Navyist Rewards program](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/browse/info.do?cid=1095422) functions as Old Navy's loyalty system within Gap Inc.'s broader rewards structure. Membership is free and open to Canadian residents aged 16 and older, including those in Quebec as of recent program updates.

Points accumulate at a rate of 1 point per dollar spent across Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, both online and in-store. Every 100 points equals $1 in rewards, redeemable at any of the participating brands. Points post to accounts in pending status initially, becoming active after 14 days. If no points are earned or redeemed for 12 consecutive months, the account balance expires.

The program operates in three tiers based on annual spending across all Gap Inc. brands: Core (under $500), Enthusiast ($500-$999), and Icon ($1,000 or more). Core members receive standard benefits including points earning and occasional promotional bonuses. Enthusiast members gain access to early sale previews and extended return windows. Icon members receive the most substantial perks, including free shipping on orders over $35 instead of $50, the ability to choose a personal 15% off sale day once per year, and priority customer service access.

Additional earning opportunities include a 250-point bonus for new members who sign up for marketing emails, birthday bonuses for members who provide their birth date, and cross-brand shopping bonuses that reward shopping at multiple Gap Inc. brands within the same calendar year (500 points for two brands, 1,000 for three, 2,000 for all four).

Super Cash promotions run periodically throughout the year, allowing shoppers to earn discount codes based on spending thresholds during earning periods. These codes can be redeemed during designated redemption windows, typically providing $10 off for every $25 spent during the earning period.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

Old Navy's [return policy](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/customerService/info.do?cid=3325) provides 30 days from purchase for standard returns, processed either by mail or in physical stores. Online purchases returned by mail can generate prepaid return labels through an interactive returns process on the website, with options for UPS or Canada Post shipping. Opting out of the prepaid label system requires customers to cover return shipping costs independently.

In-store returns require the original packaging when possible, along with either the shipping confirmation email (digital or printed) or the payment card used for the purchase. Store staff can look up orders using this information even without a physical receipt.

Gift returns without receipts receive merchandise credit in the form of an Options gift card, valued at the price paid as shown on the gift receipt or invoice. These gift cards work across all Gap Inc. brands in Canada, including Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta locations and websites.

Orders placed for in-store pickup begin their 30-day return window when the order becomes ready for pickup, not when it's placed online. This policy gives customers additional time when items sit ready at stores longer than expected.

Customer service operates daily from 7am to 1am Eastern Time at 1-800-653-6289. Mail correspondence can be sent to Old Navy Canada Customer Service, 9500 McLaughlin Road North, Brampton, ON, L6X 0B8.

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

Online orders ship free on purchases of $50 or more when customers select the "Free Every Day" shipping option during checkout. This threshold applies to the first ship-to address in an order, with coverage extending across Canada including remote locations. Delivery to remote areas typically takes up to 14 days compared to the standard 5-7 business day window for urban centres.

Icon-tier Navyist Rewards members qualify for free shipping at a reduced threshold of $35, which benefits frequent shoppers who make smaller individual purchases.

In-store pickup is available at participating locations, allowing online shoppers to collect orders at nearby stores without paying shipping costs or waiting for home delivery. This option works particularly well for time-sensitive purchases or for customers who prefer not to leave packages unattended at residential addresses.

The website includes a [store locator](https://oldnavy.gapcanada.ca/stores) that displays current locations across provinces, with filters for services like pickup availability, fitting rooms, and accessibility features. Store hours vary by location and season, with extended hours common during major sale periods and holidays.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

Old Navy employs retail workers across more than 100 Canadian locations, with positions ranging from entry-level sales associates to store management roles. The company hires workers aged 16 and older for part-time and full-time positions, with typical entry-level hourly wages ranging from $17.40 to $18.50 depending on location, experience, and provincial minimum wage requirements.

Store managers in Canada earn annual salaries generally between $60,000 and $80,000, while assistant managers typically earn around $45,000. Employee benefits include a 50% discount on regular-priced merchandise across Gap Inc. brands, 30% off outlet items, health and dental coverage, mental wellness support, retirement savings programs with RRSP matching, and paid time off.

Distribution and logistics operations support the Canadian store network, with warehousing and supply chain jobs located in Ontario. The company's Canadian head office functions operate from Brampton, handling customer service, e-commerce operations, and regional management.

Employment levels fluctuate seasonally, with increased hiring before back-to-school and holiday shopping periods. The retail sector's shift toward online shopping has affected staffing patterns, though physical stores remain central to Old Navy's business model in Canada.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

Old Navy operates on a promotional calendar with predictable high-value sale periods. Black Friday and Boxing Week consistently deliver the steepest discounts across all categories, with percentage-off deals stacking on top of already-reduced clearance items. Back-to-school sales in late July and August focus on kids' clothing and basic wardrobe staples. Mid-season clearance events in January and July reduce winter and summer inventory respectively.

Weekly promotions rotate throughout the year, often targeting specific categories—40% off dresses one week, $10 graphic tees another. Email subscribers receive early notification of these sales, sometimes with exclusive additional discounts or early access windows.

Super Cash earning periods typically align with major shopping seasons, giving customers who spend during these windows discount codes redeemable in the following weeks. This system rewards bulk purchasing during already-discounted periods, creating compound savings for strategic shoppers.

Navyist Rewards points accumulate on sale items as well as full-price purchases, allowing members to earn points while buying discounted merchandise. Combining sale pricing, Super Cash redemption, and points earning creates a multi-layered savings approach that regular customers learn to optimize.

Clearance sections in stores and online receive frequent updates, with items marked down multiple times as they age. Checking clearance regularly, especially in extended sizes that see less turnover, can surface significant finds at 50-70% off original pricing.

### Why This Brand Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

Old Navy is owned by San Francisco-based Gap Inc., but the brand's 20-plus years in Canada and network of over 100 stores make it a significant presence in the Canadian retail landscape. The company employs hundreds of Canadians, operates distribution infrastructure in the country, and designs promotional calendars that acknowledge Canadian shopping patterns and holidays.

Canadian shoppers use Old Navy differently than they might use purely Canadian retailers—it occupies a specific value position that serves practical, budget-conscious clothing needs for families. This makes it relevant to Canadians searching for affordable clothing deals, even though corporate decisions happen outside the country.

The brand's integration with the Navyist Rewards program, Canadian-specific return policies, free shipping thresholds in Canadian dollars, and store network across provinces create a shopping experience tailored to the Canadian market. Deal hunters in Canada encounter Old Navy promotions regularly enough that understanding the brand's sale cycles, loyalty program mechanics, and pricing strategies provides genuine value for household budgets.
