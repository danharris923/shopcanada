### Lowe's Canada – Now Operating as RONA

The home improvement retail landscape in Canada underwent a significant transformation when Lowe's sold its Canadian operations to Sycamore Partners in February 2023. What was once known as Lowe's Canada now operates under the RONA banner, with all former Lowe's locations being converted to RONA+ stores through 2026.

RONA inc. operates approximately 425 corporate and affiliated dealer stores across Canada under the RONA+, RONA, and Dick's Lumber banners. The network serves DIY homeowners, renovation specialists, contractors, and property managers with building materials, tools, appliances, lawn and garden products, and home decor. The company employs nearly 21,000 Canadians and maintains its headquarters in Boucherville, Quebec.

Canadian shoppers benefit from RONA's [price match guarantee](https://www.lowes.ca/customer-service/price-match-policy), which matches competitors' prices and adds an additional 10 percent discount on identical in-stock items when the competitor's price is more than $1.00 lower. This applies to both in-store and online purchases. The company also offers price adjustments on recently purchased items if the price drops within 30 days at RONA or a competitor.

The [return policy](https://www.lowes.ca/customer-service/lowes-refund-and-return-policy) allows most merchandise to be returned within 90 days with proof of receipt. Major appliances, outdoor power equipment, and furniture have a 30-day return window, while plants and shrubs purchased at RONA can be returned within one year with a receipt. Holiday items must be returned by the day of the holiday.

For contractors and business customers, the VIPpro program provides exclusive discounts and business solutions. The program is free to join and offers benefits including online order quoting, volume savings, and multi-delivery scheduling. This makes RONA a practical choice for professionals managing multiple projects.

Online shoppers at lowes.ca (which redirects to rona.ca) receive free shipping on orders over $49, though shipments cannot currently be fulfilled to Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut. [Truck delivery](https://www.lowes.ca/services/truck-delivery) is available within a 100-kilometer radius of stores, with curbside delivery standard and basic hookup included for major appliances. The company also offers [installation services](https://www.lowes.ca/services/installation-services) through certified installers for flooring, windows, doors, and other home improvement projects.

Seasonal sales typically occur during spring and fall, with Boxing Week and Black Friday offering deeper discounts on appliances, tools, and seasonal merchandise.

### What This Brand Means to Canadian Shoppers

For Canadians planning home renovations, maintaining properties, or tackling weekend DIY projects, the stores formerly known as Lowe's Canada remain familiar fixtures in communities across the country. Though the Lowe's banner has been phased out in favor of RONA branding, the retail locations continue to serve the same customer base with building materials, tools, appliances, and home improvement supplies. The transition reflects a shift in corporate ownership rather than a fundamental change in product selection or service delivery.

RONA inc., which now operates these locations, has deep roots in Canadian retail. The company maintains approximately 425 corporate and affiliated stores under multiple banners and employs nearly 21,000 Canadians. For shoppers who remember visiting Lowe's stores in Ontario, British Columbia, or other provinces, the RONA+ conversion represents continuity with updated branding rather than a departure from the products and services they relied on.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

Lowe's, the American home improvement retailer, entered the Canadian market in 2007 with its first stores in Ontario. The company gradually expanded westward into British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, eventually operating 62 locations by 2018. In 2016, Lowe's acquired RONA Inc., a Quebec-based home improvement chain with a history dating back to 1939, for $3.2 billion CAD. This acquisition gave Lowe's control of RONA's extensive store network and relocated the company's Canadian headquarters to RONA's existing base in Boucherville, Quebec.

The relationship between the two brands remained intact until November 2022, when Lowe's announced it would sell its entire Canadian retail business to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm, for $400 million. The sale was completed in February 2023, with the business operating under the name RONA inc. Over the following months, the company began converting Lowe's-branded stores to the new RONA+ banner, starting with 10 locations in Ontario in July 2023. By late 2024, RONA confirmed that all remaining Lowe's locations would be converted by 2026, marking the end of the Lowe's brand in Canada.

This transition returned the business to Canadian operational control while maintaining the store network that Lowe's had built and expanded over nearly two decades.

### Why Canadians Choose This Brand

Shoppers who previously frequented Lowe's Canada, or who now visit RONA+ locations in the same buildings, typically do so for practical reasons. The stores carry a broad range of products across multiple categories: lumber and building materials, plumbing and electrical supplies, paint and flooring, appliances, seasonal lawn and garden products, tools, and hardware. This consolidated product selection allows homeowners to source most renovation materials in a single trip.

Contractors and tradespeople value the VIPpro program, which provides business owner discounts and services tailored to commercial customers. Features like online order quoting, purchase authorization for team members, and multi-delivery scheduling address the logistical challenges of managing construction and renovation projects. The program is free to join and does not require minimum purchase thresholds.

Location convenience also matters. With over 400 stores distributed across ten provinces, many Canadians live within reasonable driving distance of a RONA location. The company's distribution network includes seven distribution centers, which support inventory availability and enable special orders for products not stocked in individual stores.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

RONA's [price match policy](https://www.lowes.ca/customer-service/price-match-policy) offers a competitive edge by matching the price of local retail competitors and adding an additional 10 percent discount. The policy applies to identical in-stock items from Canadian retail competitors, both in-store and online. The competitor's price must be more than $1.00 lower than RONA's price for the discount to apply. Price matching excludes clearance items, closeouts, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Boxing Day/Week pricing, along with special orders and delivery fees.

For purchases made at regular price, RONA will provide a price adjustment if the same item goes on sale at RONA or a competitor within 30 days of the original purchase. This policy helps shoppers who buy before seasonal sales events without needing to return and repurchase items.

The VIPpro program serves business customers with volume savings and account management tools. While it does not operate as a traditional points-based loyalty program, it provides practical benefits for contractors managing repeat purchases and project-based buying. Lowe's Pro Credit Cardholders previously received 5% off eligible purchases, though the credit offering may evolve under RONA's ongoing brand transition.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

RONA's [return policy](https://www.lowes.ca/customer-service/lowes-refund-and-return-policy) allows most merchandise to be returned within 90 days of purchase with proof of receipt. Major appliances, outdoor power equipment, and furniture have a shorter 30-day return window. Plants and shrubs can be returned for replacement or refund within one year of purchase with a receipt, reflecting the nature of living products. All other plants fall under the standard 90-day policy.

Certain products cannot be returned for hygienic reasons, including toilet seats, masks, and gloves. Custom special-order items such as doors, windows, and window treatments are also non-returnable. Products that have been cut, mixed, or opened may not qualify for refunds depending on the category. Outdoor power equipment must be unused and unopened to receive a refund; used equipment falls under the manufacturer's warranty.

For online purchases, items can be returned to any RONA store in Canada within the applicable return period. Shoppers should bring the item with a copy of the shipping confirmation email to the Returns Desk. Shipping charges are not refundable, and damaged or defective items should be reported within three days of delivery (two days for appliances).

Extended protection plans are available for purchase on select products, covering repairs and replacements beyond the manufacturer's warranty period. This option provides added security for major appliances and power tools.

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

Orders placed through lowes.ca (which now redirects to rona.ca) ship to destinations within Canada, excluding Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. Standard shipping is free on orders totaling $49 or more after discounts and before taxes. Oversized items requiring freight carriers or specialized delivery methods do not qualify for free shipping.

Some products are marked as "Online Only" and ship directly from vendors rather than RONA's warehouses. These items display the vendor's lead time on the product page, indicating how long it takes from order receipt to shipment. Items marked "In Stock" from online-only vendors typically ship within two business days.

[Truck delivery](https://www.lowes.ca/services/truck-delivery) provides curbside service for large items, with exceptions for major appliances like refrigerators, ranges, dishwashers, washers, and dryers. Curbside delivery means the item is delivered to the end of the driveway and does not include setup, assembly, or removal of packaging. Items stocked in RONA's distribution centers usually ship within 24 to 72 hours if all products in the order are available. Deliveries beyond a 50-kilometer radius from the store may incur additional charges of $1 per kilometer, with a maximum delivery radius of 100 kilometers.

For major appliances, RONA's delivery team provides basic hookup at the point of delivery. Gas appliances require a certified tradesman for final installation. One-for-one haul away is available for old appliances of the same type as the newly delivered item, but customers must request this service at the time of purchase and ensure the old appliance is unhooked, cleaned, and ready for removal.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

RONA inc. employs approximately 21,000 Canadians across its retail stores, distribution centers, and corporate headquarters in Boucherville, Quebec. The company also supports around 5,000 additional employees in stores operated by independent affiliated dealers under the RONA banner. These jobs span sales, logistics, merchandising, installation services, and administrative functions.

The transition from Lowe's ownership to Sycamore Partners brought operational control back under Canadian-based management, though the company remains owned by an American private equity firm. RONA's distribution network includes seven distribution centers that manage inventory and logistics for the retail network, supporting jobs in warehousing and supply chain operations.

In December 2024, RONA acquired All-Fab Group, one of the largest building solutions providers in Western Canada, further expanding its presence in the construction and contractor supply sector. This acquisition represents continued investment in the Canadian market and suggests long-term commitment to the home improvement retail space.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

RONA runs seasonal sales aligned with home improvement cycles. Spring sales focus on lawn and garden products, outdoor furniture, and deck and patio supplies. Fall promotions emphasize tools, heating equipment, and weatherization products as homeowners prepare for winter. Boxing Week and Black Friday generate significant discounts on appliances, power tools, and holiday decor.

The price match policy remains one of the most reliable ways to secure competitive pricing throughout the year. Shoppers who monitor competitors' flyers and online prices can request price matches at the point of sale or within 30 days of purchase. Combining this policy with seasonal promotions or clearance pricing can yield additional savings.

VIPpro members can access volume discounts on bulk purchases, which is particularly useful for contractors buying materials for multiple job sites. Signing up for the program costs nothing and provides immediate access to business-focused pricing and services.

Special Order Express items, which are not stocked in every store but are available in RONA's warehouses, typically arrive within 7 to 14 business days. Ordering these items during sales events can provide savings on products that might otherwise need to be purchased at full price from specialty suppliers.

### Why This Brand Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

Though the Lowe's brand originated in the United States and the parent company is now owned by American private equity, the retail network serves hundreds of Canadian communities and employs tens of thousands of Canadians. The stores function as local sources for building materials, appliances, and home improvement supplies, filling a practical need regardless of corporate ownership.

The transition to RONA branding acknowledges Canada's unique retail environment and restores a Canadian name to the storefronts. For shoppers tracking deals, sales cycles, and price matching opportunities, the continuity of store locations and product categories matters more than the banner above the door. Canadians planning renovations, maintaining homes, or running contracting businesses continue to rely on these stores for materials and supplies, making them relevant to a deals-focused audience.

The fact that RONA now operates the network does not diminish the utility of tracking pricing, promotions, and savings opportunities for Canadian consumers. Whether searching for "Lowe's Canada" or "RONA," shoppers are looking for the same fundamental value: competitive pricing on home improvement products delivered through a reliable retail network.
