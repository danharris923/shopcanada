# EB Games Canada

## Deal Page Content Block (300-500 words)

EB Games operates over 185 stores across Canada and has been the country's largest video game retailer for decades. Originally owned by GameStop, the Canadian operation was acquired by Quebec entrepreneur Stephan Tétreault in June 2024, marking a new chapter for the brand under independent Canadian leadership.

Canadian shoppers choose EB Games for its focus on video games, gaming hardware, pop culture collectibles, and trading cards. The retailer specializes in both new and used gaming products, with trade-in programs that let customers exchange old games, consoles, and accessories for in-store credit. The company has also introduced a trading card game trade-in program at select locations, allowing customers to buy and sell singles from various card games.

The EDGE Rewards program is free to join and offers members benefits including discounts on used items, bonus trade credit, and exclusive deal day promotions throughout the year. Members can level up to Gold, Platinum, or Onyx tiers for additional perks. The company announced in November 2025 that it plans to phase out the current EDGE program by November 2026 and replace it with an improved version, though details have not been finalized.

Return policies at EB Games allow most unopened items to be returned within 15 days of purchase. Used products come with a 30-day return policy and can be exchanged if issues arise. Extended warranties are available for added protection. The company's trade program requires items to be in working condition and includes specific requirements for games, consoles, and accessories.

EB Games opened a large concept store in Montreal in October 2025 at Cours Mont-Royal, which the company describes as a flagship location for games, collectibles, and fan experiences. The retailer has announced plans to attend major fan events across Canada with gaming tournaments, activations, and themed pop-ups focused on specific franchises.

While EB Games has maintained a strong presence in Canadian shopping malls and retail centers for years, the gaming retail landscape continues to shift toward digital distribution and online marketplaces. The brand's recent relaunch under Canadian ownership and its expansion into collectibles, trading cards, and experiential retail suggest a strategy focused on in-person community engagement rather than competing solely on game sales.

### What This Brand Means to Canadian Shoppers

EB Games has been Canada's most recognizable video game retailer for over two decades. With more than 185 stores nationwide, it serves as a central location for gamers looking to buy new releases, trade in old games, pick up gaming hardware, or browse pop culture collectibles and trading cards. While the broader retail landscape has moved toward digital game downloads and online shopping, EB Games continues to fill a role for customers who prefer in-person shopping, immediate product availability, and the ability to trade physical games for credit.

The brand underwent significant change in 2024 when Quebec entrepreneur Stephan Tétreault acquired the Canadian operation from GameStop. This shift returned EB Games to independent Canadian ownership and positioned the company to focus specifically on the Canadian market rather than operating as a subsidiary of a U.S.-based parent company.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

EB Games originated as Electronics Boutique, a U.S.-based video game and electronics retailer founded in 1977. The brand expanded into Canada during the 1990s and grew through acquisitions and new store openings across the country. In 2005, GameStop acquired Electronics Boutique, bringing the EB Games banner under its corporate ownership. While U.S. locations eventually rebranded to GameStop, Canadian stores retained the EB Games name, which had become well-established in the market.

In 2021, GameStop rebranded Canadian EB Games locations to GameStop Canada, aligning the stores with the parent company's global branding strategy. However, this change was short-lived. In June 2024, GameStop sold its Canadian operations to Stephan Tétreault, who relaunched the business under the EB Games name. The brand returned with a renewed focus on gaming retail, pop culture products, and community engagement through events and tournaments.

In October 2025, EB Games opened a new flagship concept store in Montreal at Cours Mont-Royal, marking the first major store opening since the acquisition. The company has indicated plans to expand its presence through both new locations and enhanced in-store experiences focused on gaming culture and collectibles.

### Why Canadians Choose This Brand

Canadian gamers often choose EB Games for its physical store presence, which offers the ability to see products before purchasing and access immediate availability for new releases. Unlike online-only retailers, EB Games allows customers to trade in old games, consoles, and accessories for in-store credit, which can be applied toward future purchases or used as deposits on pre-orders.

The retailer's focus on used games provides a lower-cost option for budget-conscious shoppers. Used games come with a 30-day return policy and can be exchanged if issues arise, offering some assurance when purchasing pre-owned titles. Extended warranties are available for additional coverage on games, accessories, and consoles.

Beyond games, EB Games has expanded into collectibles, apparel, and trading cards tied to gaming and pop culture franchises. The company introduced a trading card game trade-in program at select locations, allowing customers to buy and sell singles from games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon. This program is expected to roll out to additional stores across Canada.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

EB Games offers a free loyalty program called EDGE Rewards, which lets members earn points on purchases and receive additional benefits based on their tier level. Members can progress through four tiers—base, Gold, Platinum, and Onyx—with higher levels offering increased discounts and trade credit bonuses. Specific benefits have included percentage discounts on used items, bonus trade credit, and exclusive deal day promotions throughout the year.

In November 2025, EB Games announced that the current EDGE program will be discontinued by November 2026. Existing members can continue using their benefits until that date, and the company has stated it is working on a new and improved version of the program, though no launch date or details have been provided. Members should verify the status of benefits before making purchasing decisions as the transition period progresses.

Trade-in values fluctuate based on market demand, product condition, and retailer inventory needs. Trade credit never expires and can be held for future use or applied toward pre-orders. Customers must be at least 18 years old and present valid government identification to participate in the trade program. Items must be in working condition with original components, cases, and artwork where applicable to receive full value.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

EB Games allows returns or exchanges within 15 days of purchase for most unopened items, whether purchased in-store or online. Used products carry a 30-day return policy and can be exchanged for the same item if issues occur. PC games cannot be returned once opened unless they are deemed faulty, and the retailer does not accept returns based on system compatibility issues.

Extended warranties are available for purchase on games, accessories, and consoles for an additional charge. These warranties provide coverage beyond the standard return window and can be useful for customers concerned about long-term product performance.

Trade-ins are subject to manager approval and must meet specific requirements. Games must include original cases, artwork, and instructions to qualify for full value. Consoles require all applicable cables, power adapters, and at least one controller. Items with parental controls that cannot be removed, cracked or severely damaged screens, or evidence of modification are not accepted. The retailer does not accept multiple copies of the same game or system from the same customer, and burned, pirated, or counterfeit games are rejected.

Online returns require customers to contact customer service for authorization before shipping items back. Processing times can take up to 20 business days once the return is received at the warehouse.

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

EB Games operates an e-commerce site at [ebgames.ca](https://www.ebgames.ca/) where customers can browse inventory, place orders, and manage EDGE Rewards accounts. The website includes trade-in value estimators, pre-order options, and access to online-exclusive promotions. Shipping is available across Canada, though delivery times and costs vary by location and product type.

For customers who prefer not to pay shipping fees, EB Games offers in-store pickup options where available. This allows online orders to be collected at a nearby retail location, combining the convenience of online browsing with the immediacy of in-person pickup.

The trade-in program primarily operates through physical stores rather than online, requiring customers to bring items directly to a location for assessment and credit issuance. Online trade options have not been widely implemented, meaning customers outside urban centers with nearby stores may have limited access to trade programs.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

EB Games employs retail staff across more than 185 locations in Canada, providing positions in sales, store management, and customer service. The company also maintains distribution and logistics operations to support its store network. With the brand now under Canadian ownership following the 2024 acquisition, operational decisions and strategic planning are managed domestically rather than directed from a U.S. parent company.

The retailer's presence in shopping malls and retail centers contributes to foot traffic in commercial districts, particularly in suburban and smaller urban markets where EB Games may be one of the primary specialty gaming retailers. Stores often serve as gathering points for gaming communities, hosting midnight launches, tournaments, and fan events.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

EB Games runs promotions throughout the year tied to major gaming release cycles and retail events. Black Friday, Boxing Week, and back-to-school periods typically feature discounts on games, accessories, and consoles. The retailer also participates in trade-in bonus events where customers receive extra credit on specific titles or hardware.

EDGE members receive access to exclusive deal days with flash sales and limited-time offers sent via email. These promotions often include percentage discounts on used games and collectibles, though stackability with other promotions varies. Members should review the official EDGE program page at [ebgames.ca](https://www.ebgames.ca/edge/) for current benefit details as the program transitions toward its replacement in 2026.

Pre-order discounts and bundle deals are common for major game releases, with EDGE members sometimes receiving additional savings or exclusive bonuses. Trade credit can be applied toward pre-orders, allowing customers to reduce upfront costs on upcoming titles by trading in older games.

Used game prices represent another savings opportunity, particularly for titles no longer in active production or games released more than a year prior. Prices on used inventory fluctuate based on supply and demand, and popular titles may have limited availability at lower price points.

### Why This Brand Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

EB Games is now independently owned and operated in Canada, making it distinct from its former parent company GameStop. While the brand originated in the United States and operated for years as part of a multinational retail chain, its current structure centers on the Canadian market with decision-making controlled domestically.

For Canadian shoppers, EB Games provides access to gaming products through a network of physical stores that spans urban, suburban, and some smaller market areas. The trade-in program, used game selection, and in-person shopping experience differentiate it from digital storefronts and online-only retailers. While the gaming industry continues to shift toward digital distribution, EB Games maintains relevance for customers who value physical media, trade-in options, and immediate product availability.
