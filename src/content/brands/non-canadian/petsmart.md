### PetSmart Canada

PetSmart operates more than 140 stores across Canada and has been serving Canadian pet owners since 1996. The retailer specializes in pet food, supplies, and accessories for dogs, cats, fish, reptiles, birds, and small animals, alongside services including grooming, training, boarding through PetsHotel, and Doggie Day Camp.

Canadian shoppers often choose PetSmart for its combination of retail selection and professional pet services under one roof. The [Treats Rewards loyalty program](https://www.petsmart.ca/treats-rewards.html) operates at no cost to join and rewards members with 10 points for every dollar spent on both products and services. Points accumulate toward discounts on future purchases, with higher-tier members earning bonus points. Bestie-tier members earn an additional 2 points per dollar, while VIPP members earn an additional 4 points per dollar. Customers who adopt a pet during the calendar year automatically receive VIPP status through the end of the following year.

[Return policies](https://www.petsmart.ca/help/returns-and-refunds-H0008a.html) allow most products to be returned within 60 days of purchase in original packaging. Online orders can be returned in any PetSmart store location with the shipping confirmation email serving as proof of purchase. Prescription medications and special orders cannot be returned, which is standard practice in the pet retail category.

PetSmart ships to select areas throughout Canada, though coverage varies by postal code. Same-day delivery became available nationwide in 2022 through a partnership with Skip, extending PetSmart's reach to over 450 cities and towns. The Autoship subscription program offers scheduled deliveries with discounts on repeat orders, though this service is not currently available for Quebec addresses.

The retailer runs predictable seasonal promotions throughout the year. Boxing Week, Black Friday, and back-to-school periods typically feature discounts on larger items such as crates, aquariums, and bulk pet food. The Treats Rewards program occasionally provides exclusive early access to sales for higher-tier members. PetSmart also participates in National Adoption Week each year, working with local animal welfare organizations to facilitate in-store adoptions. PetSmart Charities of Canada has facilitated over 400,000 pet adoptions since its founding 25 years ago.

## What PetSmart Means to Canadian Pet Owners

PetSmart has operated as a significant presence in Canadian pet retail for nearly three decades, offering a combination of product selection and onsite services that address routine pet care needs. The chain's more than 140 Canadian locations employ approximately 4,800 people across roles in retail, grooming, training, and animal care. For many Canadians, PetSmart represents accessible veterinary-adjacent services such as grooming and boarding without requiring an appointment weeks in advance, alongside the ability to purchase food, supplies, and accessories during the same visit.

The retailer's physical footprint spans urban centers and suburban communities in most provinces, with particularly dense coverage in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Atlantic Canada. PetSmart stores typically occupy large retail spaces that accommodate live animal habitats, grooming salons, training areas, and in many locations, dedicated PetsHotel boarding facilities. This consolidation of services distinguishes the chain from smaller independent pet stores or grocery retailers that stock pet food but lack grooming or training infrastructure.

## Brand History and Entry Into Canada

PetSmart was founded in Arizona in 1986 as PetFood Warehouse, initially focused on high-volume pet food sales. The company rebranded to PetSmart in 1988 and expanded rapidly throughout the United States during the early 1990s. After opening nearly 300 stores in the U.S., the company entered Canada in 1996 with its first eight Canadian locations. At the time, PetSmart executives noted that Canadians demonstrated strong preferences for specialty pet retailers compared to general merchandise stores, making the Canadian market particularly well-suited to the company's warehouse-style format.

By 1998, PetSmart had expanded to 18 Canadian stores, and the company continued steady growth in the decades that followed. The brand positioned itself as a category-dominant retailer, emphasizing breadth of inventory and service offerings rather than competing primarily on price. During the 2000s, PetSmart introduced grooming salons, training programs, and PetsHotel locations to Canadian stores, aligning its Canadian operations with the service-focused model already established in U.S. markets.

PetSmart's Canadian operations have remained distinct in certain respects, including separate loyalty programs and customer service infrastructure. The company established PetSmart Charities of Canada as an independent entity to support animal welfare organizations throughout the country. This separate charitable arm has facilitated over 400,000 pet adoptions in Canada since its founding 25 years ago, working with nearly 4,000 animal welfare organizations across North America to bring adoptable pets into store adoption centers.

## Why Canadians Choose PetSmart

Canadian pet owners often select PetSmart for practical reasons related to convenience and service accessibility. The ability to book grooming appointments, enroll in training classes, and arrange boarding while purchasing food and supplies during a single visit addresses multiple aspects of pet ownership without requiring separate trips to specialty providers. This becomes particularly relevant for dog owners managing grooming schedules, as PetSmart groomers complete over 800 hours of hands-on training and safety certification, meeting professional standards comparable to independent groomers but with broader availability.

PetSmart's product assortment covers mainstream brands widely advertised in pet care, alongside premium and specialty formulations for specific dietary requirements. The retailer stocks prescription diets from major veterinary brands, which can be convenient for pet owners whose veterinarians recommend therapeutic nutrition. Live animal sales include fish, reptiles, birds, and small animals such as hamsters and guinea pigs, supported by staff trained in basic husbandry and habitat setup.

The in-store adoption program represents another distinctive element. Rather than selling dogs or cats, PetSmart allocates space within stores to adoption centers managed by local animal shelters and rescue organizations. This model has allowed thousands of Canadian pets to meet potential adopters in high-traffic retail environments. Customers who adopt through these programs automatically receive VIPP status in the Treats Rewards program through the end of the following calendar year, providing enhanced rewards on pet supplies purchased during the critical early months of pet ownership.

## Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

The [Treats Rewards program](https://www.petsmart.ca/treats-rewards.html) operates as PetSmart's primary customer retention and loyalty mechanism. Membership is free and open to Canadian residents aged 18 and older. The base earning rate is 10 points per dollar spent on products and services, including grooming, training, and boarding. Points convert to dollar-value discounts that can be redeemed on future purchases, with thresholds set at 1,000 points ($8 off) and 2,500 points ($25 off).

The program includes two elevated tiers based on annual spending. Bestie status requires spending over $500 in a calendar year and provides an additional 2 points per dollar, one personal 2X points day per year, and early access to select sales. VIPP status requires spending over $1,000 annually and provides an additional 4 points per dollar, two personal 2X points days, tier appreciation events, early sale access, and a holiday gift. Tier status earned in one year carries through the end of the following year, meaning customers must maintain spending levels to retain benefits.

Members also earn 2X points on donations to PetSmart Charities of Canada made at checkout or online. The program occasionally offers promotions such as "buy 10 Doggie Day Camp sessions, get 1 free," stacking incremental savings for customers who use services regularly. Adoption through PetSmart's in-store program grants automatic VIPP status, regardless of prior spending.

PetSmart's general pricing positions it as a mid-market retailer, typically priced higher than warehouse clubs or online discount retailers but lower than boutique pet stores. The chain does not advertise broad price-matching policies, instead relying on Treats Rewards and periodic sales to provide value. Autoship subscriptions offer percentage discounts on scheduled deliveries of food, litter, and other consumables, though this service is unavailable to Quebec addresses.

## Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

PetSmart's [return policy](https://www.petsmart.ca/help/returns-and-refunds-H0008a.html) allows most products to be returned within 60 days of purchase provided they remain in original packaging. Returns can be processed in any PetSmart store location or by mail for online purchases. Customers returning online orders in-store need the shipping confirmation email as proof of purchase. Refunds are issued to the original payment method, minus shipping, handling, and gift wrap charges.

Prescription medications and special orders cannot be returned, consistent with industry standards for regulated and custom products. Live animals are subject to separate policies. Customers who receive damaged or defective products should contact customer service within 30 days of delivery for replacement or refund options.

Service-related issues, such as grooming concerns, are typically addressed directly with store management or the grooming salon. PetSmart emphasizes safety protocols in grooming, citing completion of extensive training programs by all stylists. The company does not publicly advertise service guarantees but handles complaints on a case-by-case basis.

## Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

PetSmart ships to select areas throughout Canada, with coverage varying by postal code. Customers can verify delivery eligibility by entering their address during checkout. Certain products, including live pets, canned food, frozen food, and select cat litters, are excluded from shipping altogether and must be purchased in-store.

Standard [shipping policies](https://www.petsmart.ca/help/shipping-and-delivery-H0007a.a.html) apply to online orders, with delivery timelines depending on location and product availability. PetSmart introduced same-day delivery in 2022 through a partnership with Skip, extending availability to over 450 cities and towns across Canada. Customers in eligible areas can order over 15,000 PetSmart products through the Skip platform for on-demand delivery.

The Autoship program offers scheduled deliveries with automatic discounts on recurring orders. Customers select delivery frequency, and shipments process automatically until canceled. Quebec postal codes are excluded from Autoship eligibility, limiting this service for francophone customers and reducing accessibility in Canada's second-largest province.

Buy online, pick up in-store options are available for most products, allowing customers to reserve items for same-day pickup. Orders not collected within three days are returned to stock, and refunds are issued to the original payment method.

## Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

PetSmart employs approximately 4,800 people across its Canadian operations, spanning retail associates, groomers, trainers, PetsHotel staff, and management roles. Each store functions as a local employer, with positions ranging from entry-level sales associates to leadership roles overseeing store operations, merchandising, and pet care.

Grooming positions require completion of PetSmart's training program, which involves over 800 hours of hands-on instruction and safety certification. This structured training pathway provides skill development for individuals entering the pet services industry. Training instructors deliver curricula based on PetSmart's standardized programs, teaching obedience and behavior modification techniques to dog owners.

PetSmart's Canadian supply chain includes distribution relationships with Canadian pet food manufacturers and importers, though the company sources many products from international suppliers. The eight PetsHotel facilities operating in Canada provide extended-hours and overnight pet care, employing staff trained in animal supervision and basic medical observation.

PetSmart Charities of Canada operates independently as the country's leading funder of animal welfare, distributing grants to shelters, rescue organizations, and spay/neuter programs. This charitable work runs parallel to the retail business but represents community investment that extends beyond commercial operations.

## How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

PetSmart's promotional calendar follows predictable seasonal patterns. Black Friday and Boxing Week typically feature the deepest discounts on high-value items such as large aquariums, dog crates, cat trees, and bulk pet food. Back-to-school promotions in late summer often include discounts on small animal supplies and starter kits for families acquiring new pets.

The Treats Rewards program provides incremental savings year-round, with higher-tier members receiving early access to select sales events and tier-specific appreciation offers. PetSmart occasionally runs limited-time promotions offering bonus points on specific product categories or brands, stacking additional value for loyalty members.

Autoship subscribers receive automatic discounts on recurring orders, providing ongoing savings on consumables such as food, litter, treats, and flea prevention products. The subscription model benefits customers willing to commit to regular delivery schedules but excludes Quebec residents.

PetSmart's clearance sections often include discontinued items, seasonal products, and overstocked merchandise at reduced prices. Availability varies by location, and clearance inventory changes frequently based on local store decisions.

Service promotions occasionally include package deals on grooming, discounted Doggie Day Camp multi-packs, or introductory offers for first-time training customers. The chain advertises monthly service specials that rotate based on seasonal demand.

## Why PetSmart Belongs on a Canada-Focused Deals Site

PetSmart has operated in Canada for nearly three decades and employs thousands of Canadians across retail, grooming, training, and animal care roles. While the company is headquartered in the United States, its Canadian stores function as local employers and service providers embedded in communities nationwide. The Treats Rewards program, return policies, and shipping infrastructure are configured for Canadian customers, and PetSmart Charities of Canada operates as an independent entity addressing Canadian animal welfare priorities.

Canadian pet owners interact with PetSmart as a domestic retailer offering accessible services and broad product selection at mid-market pricing. The company's promotional cycles, loyalty incentives, and service offerings align with Canadian shopping patterns and seasonal demand. For these reasons, PetSmart merits inclusion alongside other retailers serving the Canadian market, regardless of corporate ownership structure.
