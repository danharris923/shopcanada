### What Michaels Means to Canadian Shoppers

Michaels has become a familiar destination for Canadian crafters, DIY enthusiasts, educators, and seasonal decorators. With 134 stores spread across the country, the retailer serves as a primary source for art supplies, framing services, and project materials. Canadian shoppers visit Michaels for everything from professional-grade paints and canvases to yarn, scrapbooking materials, floral supplies, and holiday décor. The brand's presence extends beyond urban centers into smaller communities, providing access to specialized craft materials that might otherwise require online ordering or cross-border shopping.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

Michael J. Dupey founded Michaels in Dallas, Texas, in 1973 after converting a struggling five-and-dime store into an arts and crafts retailer. The concept proved successful, and the company expanded throughout the southern and southwestern United States over the following two decades. Michaels entered the Canadian market in 1993 with two stores in Toronto, Ontario, marking the company's first international expansion. This move extended Michaels' footprint beyond the United States for the first time and established a foundation for growth across Canadian provinces.

The company continued opening locations throughout the 1990s and 2000s, eventually reaching its current network of 134 stores. Today, Michaels operates as part of a larger retail portfolio that includes over 1,300 stores across North America. In 2021, private equity firm Apollo Global Management acquired The Michaels Companies, taking the retailer private. The company has since invested in store renovations and new location formats, including an updated concept that debuted in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 2023.

### Why Canadians Choose Michaels

Canadian customers gravitate toward Michaels for its comprehensive selection of craft and art supplies under one roof. The retailer stocks materials for diverse creative pursuits, from traditional fine arts and scrapbooking to modern techniques like vinyl cutting with Cricut machines and resin casting. Seasonal shoppers appreciate the extensive holiday décor sections that rotate throughout the year, featuring everything from artificial Christmas trees and wreaths to Easter crafting supplies and Halloween decorations.

Custom framing services draw customers who need professional preservation for artwork, photographs, jerseys, and memorabilia. Michaels employs trained framing specialists who guide customers through material selection, design choices, and conservation techniques. This service appeals to Canadian shoppers who prefer in-person consultation and local pickup rather than shipping delicate framed items.

The retailer's in-store classes and workshops create community connections for hobbyists and beginners. Michaels offers [in-store experiences](https://canada.michaels.com/classes) that teach skills like watercolor painting, jewelry making, floral arranging, and cake decorating. These sessions welcome participants of all skill levels and include necessary materials, making it easy for Canadians to try new crafts without significant upfront investment in supplies or equipment.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

Michaels employs a frequent coupon strategy that rewards shoppers who plan their purchases around weekly promotions. The retailer distributes coupons through multiple channels, including the [weekly ad](https://canada.michaels.com/weekly-ad) on canada.michaels.com, the Michaels mobile app, email subscriptions, and newspaper inserts. Common offers include 40% off single regular-priced items, with occasional increases to 50% during major promotional periods.

The free [Michaels Rewards program](https://canada.michaels.com/rewards) provides Canadian members with department-specific coupons, advance notice of sales, and invitations to exclusive events. While the full tiered rewards program available in the United States has not yet launched in Canada, the current Canadian program delivers targeted discounts based on shopping preferences. Reward coupons arrive via email and remain valid for specific time periods, typically not exceeding 30 days from the issue date.

Additional discounts serve specific customer groups. Seniors aged 55 and older receive 10% off regular and sale-priced items every day, both in-store and online. Educators qualify for 15% off their entire purchase when presenting valid educator identification at any Canadian store location. Active military members, veterans, and their immediate families receive 15% off regular and sale-priced items in-store with proper verification.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

Michaels maintains a flexible [return policy](https://canada.michaels.com/return-policy) that accommodates purchases made with or without receipts. Customers returning items without proof of purchase must present valid photo identification issued by Canadian, U.S., or Mexican authorities. Refunds without receipts are calculated based on the item's current sale price or 20% off the regular price, whichever is lower, and issued as store credit via a Store Return Card.

Custom framing purchases follow different guidelines due to their personalized nature. Customers who are unsatisfied with their custom framing can return the piece to the original store location within 14 days of pickup. Michaels will rework the framing at no additional charge until the customer approves the final product. This policy acknowledges that framing involves subjective design choices and provides recourse without requiring full refunds for custom work.

Items damaged or defective during the manufacturer's warranty period must be returned directly to the manufacturer except where required by law. Certain products carry return restrictions, including unopened Cricut machines (which require original packaging and receipt), gift cards, and prepaid cards (non-returnable except where legally mandated).

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

Michaels operates a dedicated Canadian e-commerce platform at canada.michaels.com, separate from the U.S. site that does not ship to Canada. Canadian customers can browse the full product catalog online and choose between [shipping options](https://canada.michaels.com/shipping-policy) that include standard ground delivery (3-5 business days) and expedited service (1 business day). Expedited orders placed before 11:00 AM Central Time on business days ship the same day and typically arrive within one business day. Orders placed after this cutoff process the following business day.

Free shipping applies to orders over $59 before taxes and fees. The retailer also offers Buy Online, Pick Up in Store service across all Canadian locations, allowing customers to place orders online and collect them the same day at their nearest store. This option eliminates shipping costs and wait times for customers who live near Michaels locations.

Same-day delivery through Instacart serves 100 Canadian stores, providing delivery in as fast as one hour for customers who need supplies immediately. This partnership extends Michaels' convenience for time-sensitive projects or last-minute seasonal decorating needs. All products purchased online, whether shipped or picked up in-store, qualify for free returns at any Canadian Michaels location.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

Michaels employs thousands of Canadians across its 134 retail locations, distribution operations, and corporate functions. Store positions include sales associates, department specialists, custom framing designers, and management roles. The company hires seasonal staff to support increased customer traffic during peak periods like back-to-school, Halloween, and the winter holiday season.

The retailer participates in inclusive hiring initiatives, including the Makers Like Me program piloted in Ontario stores. This program intentionally recruits candidates with disabilities, supporting workplace diversity and providing employment opportunities for equity-deserving groups. Michaels also established Michaels Resource Groups to raise awareness around diversity and inclusion while supporting employee professional development.

Store operations create local economic activity through employment, property taxes, and supply chain relationships. Distribution centers serving Canadian stores require logistics workers, truck drivers, and warehouse staff to maintain inventory flow. While corporate headquarters remain in Texas, Canadian store operations function with regional management and local hiring practices.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

Michaels follows predictable seasonal sale cycles that allow savvy shoppers to time major purchases. Black Friday and the extended November sale period typically deliver the year's deepest discounts, with savings reaching 60-70% on holiday décor, craft supplies, and seasonal items. Boxing Day offers similar markdowns, particularly on remaining holiday inventory and winter crafting materials.

Back-to-school season in late summer brings promotions on organizational supplies, children's craft kits, and art materials for students. End-of-season clearance sales rotate throughout the year, offering significant discounts on floral arrangements, seasonal décor, and holiday-specific crafting supplies. These clearance periods help Michaels transition inventory between seasons while providing value-conscious shoppers access to discounted materials.

Stacking strategies can maximize savings for informed customers. Combining weekly coupons with sale prices delivers compounded discounts, while Rewards members receive early sale notifications that allow first access to limited-quantity doorbuster deals. Seniors and educators can apply their everyday discounts to sale items in most cases, creating additional savings layers during promotional periods.

The retailer's weekly ad, available online and through the mobile app, previews upcoming promotions and featured deals. Subscribing to email communications ensures Canadians receive advance notice of members-only events and exclusive coupon codes before they become widely available.

### Why Michaels Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

Michaels maintains substantial Canadian retail infrastructure with 134 stores, dedicated Canadian e-commerce operations, and thousands of local employees. While the company originated in the United States and remains headquartered in Texas, its three-decade presence in Canada and extensive store network serve Canadian shoppers who depend on local access to craft supplies, seasonal décor, and custom framing services.

Canadian customers benefit from policies and programs designed specifically for the Canadian market, including a dedicated website, Canadian-specific shipping arrangements, Rewards program adapted for Canadian members, and store events that accommodate local communities. The retailer's significance to Canadian crafters, educators, and DIY enthusiasts extends beyond its international ownership to its practical role as a primary supplier of creative materials across the country.
