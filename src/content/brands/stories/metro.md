# Metro

Metro Inc. traces its origins to 1947 when a group of independent grocers in Montreal formed a buying cooperative to compete with larger chains. That cooperative grew through decades of mergers and acquisitions into one of Canada's three major grocery companies, alongside Loblaw and Empire (Sobeys). Today, Metro operates over 950 food stores and 650 pharmacies across Ontario and Quebec, employing more than 97,000 people.

## Two Provinces, Multiple Banners

Metro's stores operate under several banners tailored to different markets and price points. In Quebec, the Metro banner serves the mainstream grocery market while Super C targets budget-conscious shoppers with a no-frills warehouse format. In Ontario, Metro stores serve the same mainstream role while Food Basics fills the discount niche. The company also operates Adonis, a chain specializing in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods, and Première Moisson, an artisan bakery chain. This multi-banner strategy lets Metro serve different customer segments without diluting any single brand.

## Jean Coutu and Pharmacy

Metro's acquisition of the Jean Coutu Group in 2018 for approximately $4.5 billion was a transformative deal. Jean Coutu, founded in 1969 by pharmacist Jean Coutu in Montreal, had built one of Quebec's most beloved pharmacy brands with over 400 locations. The merger gave Metro a massive pharmacy network to complement its grocery operations, creating a food and health conglomerate that rivals Loblaw's combination of grocery and Shoppers Drug Mart. The Jean Coutu and Brunet pharmacy banners continue to operate under the Metro umbrella.

## Publicly Traded, Quebec-Based

Metro trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker MRU and has been one of the steadiest performers in Canadian retail. The company is headquartered in Montreal and has a reputation for disciplined financial management. Unlike Loblaw, which has expanded into banking and fashion, Metro has stayed focused on food and pharmacy, a strategy that has served its shareholders well.
