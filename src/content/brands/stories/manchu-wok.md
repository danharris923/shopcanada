# Manchu Wok

OUR STORY A WOK DOWN MEMORY LANE Picture this: Peterborough, Ontario. 1980. Let’s just say it was a Tuesday. The song Funkytown was dominating the airwaves and the first ManchuWOK® had just opened its doors, changing the mall, food courts, and our lives forever.

It was a place where customers would come and enjoy restaurant quality Chinese cuisine in a fast and friendly setting. The success of this first location generated demand throughout the province and soon spread across North America, prompting multiple store expansions.

Through the 90s, ManchuWOK® was made more accessible to fans of Asian cuisine by gaining greater exposure in non-traditional markets, like Universities and Airports. By 2004, the chain made its mark overseas by bringing the ManchuWOK® brand to Guam, Japan and most recently Dubai.

In our 40 years plus of opening our first locations, ManchuWOK® continues to make authentic, chef-inspired Chinese food exactly the way it should be. Using the power of the WOK.
