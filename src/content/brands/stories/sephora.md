## What Sephora Means to Canadian Shoppers

Sephora occupies a distinct position in Canada's beauty retail landscape. For shoppers seeking prestige cosmetics, skincare, and fragrance, the retailer offers direct access to brands historically available only at department store beauty counters.

## Canadian Jobs & Operations

Sephora employs more than 3,600 people in Canada, with positions spanning retail stores, corporate offices, distribution centres, and e-commerce operations. The Canadian head office, opened in February 2007, manages the country's retail operations independently.

## Beauty Insider Program

The three-tier Beauty Insider program rewards members with points, birthday gifts, and early sale access. Rouge members ($1,000+ annual spending) get free shipping and can redeem 2,500 points for $100 off. Semi-annual savings events offer 10-20% off.
