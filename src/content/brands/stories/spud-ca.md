# SPUD

Peter van Stolk founded SPUD (Sustainable Produce Urban Delivery) in 1997 in Vancouver, British Columbia, making it one of the earliest online grocery delivery services in North America. The concept was ahead of its time: customers could order organic produce, natural foods, and household essentials online and have them delivered to their door. This was years before grocery delivery became mainstream, and van Stolk — who had previously founded Jones Soda — saw an opportunity to connect urban consumers directly with local organic farmers.

## Local and Organic Focus

SPUD's core mission has always been to support local food systems and make organic, sustainably produced food accessible to more people. The company partners with hundreds of local farmers, ranchers, bakers, and food producers across British Columbia and Alberta, prioritizing products that are organic, non-GMO, and produced with sustainable practices. The selection includes fresh produce, dairy, meats, bakery items, pantry staples, and prepared meals. SPUD operates its own warehouses and delivery fleet, maintaining a cold chain that ensures fresh products arrive in peak condition.

## The Delivery Model

SPUD delivers to homes across Metro Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, and Edmonton using a route-based delivery system designed to minimize environmental impact. Customers order through the website, choosing from weekly featured items and a full catalogue of thousands of products. The company uses reusable bins and insulated bags, which drivers collect on subsequent deliveries, reducing packaging waste. Delivery fees are kept low to encourage regular ordering, and the company offers subscription-style programs for staple items.

## Sustainable Business

Beyond sourcing organic and local products, SPUD has built sustainability into its operations. The company has invested in electric delivery vehicles, carbon offset programs, and zero-waste initiatives at its distribution centres. SPUD also operates the Be Fresh brand of prepared foods and has expanded its offerings to include meal kits and specialty diet options. In a Canadian grocery market increasingly dominated by a handful of massive corporations, SPUD represents an alternative model — smaller, local-focused, and committed to the idea that how food is produced and delivered matters.
