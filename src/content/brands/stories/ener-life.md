# Ener-Life

Ener-Life is a Canadian health and wellness brand that emerged from the ashes of the original Ener-C vitamin company. When Ener-C was acquired by a large pharmaceutical corporation, a group of the original team members — passionate about natural health and unwilling to watch their creation become just another corporate product line — left to start fresh. Ener-Life was founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a mission to create high-quality vitamin and supplement products without the compromises that come with big pharma ownership.

## Vitamin C and Beyond

The brand's flagship products are effervescent vitamin C drink mixes, building on the expertise the founders developed during their years with the original Ener-C brand. The drink mixes dissolve in water and deliver vitamin C alongside other vitamins and minerals in a convenient, pleasant-tasting format. The product line has expanded to include multivitamins, electrolyte formulas, and other targeted supplements, all designed around the principle that taking your vitamins shouldn't feel like a chore.

## Clean Formulations

Ener-Life formulates its products without artificial sweeteners, flavours, or colours, using natural fruit flavours and mineral ascorbates for a gentler form of vitamin C that's easier on the stomach than ascorbic acid alone. The brand is transparent about its ingredient sourcing and manufacturing processes, and products are made in Canada under strict quality controls. Each formula is developed to maximize bioavailability — how well your body can actually absorb and use the nutrients.

## Independent and Canadian

Operating independently from its Vancouver base, Ener-Life sells through its online store, Amazon Canada, and health food retailers across the country. The brand has built a loyal following among Canadians who remember the original Ener-C and appreciate that the people behind it chose to start over rather than compromise on quality. For health-conscious consumers who want their supplements made by people who genuinely care about the product, Ener-Life represents the road less travelled in a supplement industry dominated by corporate giants.
