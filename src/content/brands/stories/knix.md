# Knix

Joanna Griffiths founded Knix in Toronto in 2013 after completing her MBA at INSEAD. She launched the brand on Kickstarter with a line of leak-proof underwear, raising over $80,000 and validating a product concept that most traditional intimates companies had ignored. A decade later, Knix has sold over 20 million pairs of underwear and built one of Canada's most successful direct-to-consumer brands.

## Solving a Real Problem

The core innovation behind Knix is its leak-proof technology, designed for periods, light bladder leaks, sweat, and discharge. What set Knix apart from medical-grade incontinence products was making functional underwear that actually looked and felt like regular intimates. The brand's patented Leakproof technology uses thin, absorbent layers built directly into the fabric, eliminating the bulk and stigma associated with traditional solutions. This approach resonated with millions of women who had been underserved by an industry focused more on aesthetics than function.

## From DTC to Retail

Knix began as an online-only brand but has expanded into physical retail with stores in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Vancouver. The stores offer personal shopping appointments and a tactile experience that helps customers find the right fit across bras, underwear, swimwear, activewear, and loungewear. The product line has grown well beyond the original leak-proof underwear to include wireless bras, maternity and postpartum products, sleepwear, and a teen line. In 2022, Essity, a global hygiene and health company, acquired Knix, providing resources for further expansion while keeping operations based in Toronto.

## Body Positivity as a Business Model

Knix built its brand around inclusive marketing before it became an industry standard. Campaigns feature women of all sizes, ages, and backgrounds, shot without retouching. The brand's annual Swim campaign and its partnership with real customers as models have generated massive engagement on social media. Size ranges extend from XS to XXXL across most products, and the brand has consistently pushed the intimates industry toward greater representation.
