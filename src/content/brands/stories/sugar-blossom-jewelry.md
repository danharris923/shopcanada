# Sugar Blossom Jewelry

Sugar Blossom Jewelry is a Canadian jewellery brand founded by Kelli Miller in Winnipeg in 2008. The brand began when Miller started crafting one-of-a-kind pieces using her mother's old jewellery and vintage finds — repurposing forgotten pieces into something new and wearable. What started as a creative hobby quickly gained attention when strangers began stopping her on the streets of Toronto to ask about her handmade designs, and a business was born.

## From Vintage to Original

While Sugar Blossom's origins are in repurposed vintage jewellery, the brand has evolved into a full collection of original designs. The line includes earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings that blend bohemian sensibility with modern wearability. Miller's designs tend toward bold, textured, and nature-inspired pieces — think hammered metals, raw crystals, and organic shapes that feel artisanal without being precious. The aesthetic is approachable and versatile, with pieces that work for everyday wear and special occasions alike.

## Handmade in Canada

Each piece of Sugar Blossom jewellery is designed and handcrafted in Canada, maintaining the artisanal spirit that defined the brand from day one. Miller works with sterling silver, gold-fill, brass, and semi-precious stones, selecting materials for their quality and character. The handmade process means slight variations between pieces — a feature, not a flaw — that gives each item the individuality that first attracted customers to the brand. Production runs are small, and popular designs often sell out before being restocked.

## Winnipeg to the World

Sugar Blossom Jewelry sells through its online store and at select retailers and markets across Canada. Since 2008, the brand has grown from one woman's creative experiment into a recognized Canadian jewellery label, while keeping the handmade, personal touch that made it special in the first place. For Canadians who want jewellery with character and a real story behind it, Sugar Blossom delivers something that mass-produced accessories never can.
