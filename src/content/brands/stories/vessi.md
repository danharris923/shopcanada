# Vessi

We Had To Do ThisLike everyone else in Vancouver, we’d had too many wet socks and too many rainchecks. Done with rainy days holding us back, we set out to create something different.A sneaker that was actually waterproof. Not water resistant like other brands.We wanted to walk through huge puddles without a care in the world in shoes that felt comfy and looked cool. And now we do with a community who loves water in all its forms. Vessi Was Going To Be DifferentWaterproof footwear was always looked at as heavy, clunky, uncomfortable and unstylish. We wanted the opposite.Our Dyma-tex™ technology was the game changer. It’s soft, flexible and breathable, yet almost magically keeps water out. Suddenly, we could create the shoes and apparel that everyone loves to wear with the added benefit of being waterproof. Learn More
