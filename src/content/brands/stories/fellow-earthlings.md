# Fellow Earthlings

Fellow Earthlings is an eyewear production workshop located on Prince Edward Island, one of the few places in Canada where glasses are actually manufactured rather than just designed. The company produces sunglasses and optical frames from recycled acetate, turning what would otherwise be manufacturing waste into handcrafted eyewear. Their special projects division also handles prototype development and custom manufacturing for other brands, making the PEI workshop a genuine production facility rather than a storefront with a design label.

## Recycled Acetate Eyewear

The Fellow Earthlings recycled acetate collection is an ongoing sustainability project that brings new life to manufacturing waste. The 6MM Collection features frames cut from 6mm recycled acetate in styles like Mikey, Eddie, Jeannie, and Billie, while the 10MM TENS Collection uses thicker 10mm recycled acetate to create bold, one-of-one limited edition sunglasses — each pair uniquely patterned by the recycled material it came from. The optical line offers prescription-ready recycled acetate frames for everyday wear. A metals collection rounds out the range for those who prefer wire frames.

## Made on the Island

Operating a full eyewear production workshop on Prince Edward Island is unusual in an industry dominated by Italian and Chinese manufacturing. Fellow Earthlings maintains the entire production process on the island, from raw material processing to finished frames, giving them complete control over quality and environmental impact. The limited-edition, numbered nature of many pieces reflects the small-batch reality of island manufacturing — when you work with recycled materials, no two sheets of acetate look the same, making each frame genuinely unique.

## Shipping Worldwide

Fellow Earthlings ships from PEI to over 30 countries worldwide and sells through their online store. For Canadians who want eyewear that is both locally manufactured and environmentally responsible, Fellow Earthlings offers something rare — glasses actually made in Canada from materials that would otherwise end up in a landfill.
