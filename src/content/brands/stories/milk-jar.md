# Milk Jar

AboutWho is Milk Jar? Started by one humanWhen Milk Jar was born in founder Holly Singer’s kitchen in November, 2016, it answered two of her desires: to bring clean-burning, beautifully smelling candles to the local market, and to be a vehicle for giving back.

Years prior, while studying Kinesiology in University, Holly developed a close friendship with a boy with Cerebral Palsy and his mother. Forever struck by the resilience of people with disabilities and the barriers they face, it was Holly's goal to raise $500 in Milk Jar’s first year for programs that support learning and growth.

Little did she know, Milk Jar would grow to make a far, far greater impact than she ever could have imagined. To help all humansEight years later, Milk Jar has become a household name in Calgary. Not only are we incredibly proud to model inclusive employment, we’re also known for our yearly donations to non-profits supporting initiatives toward inclusion and safe workplaces.

We still make (incredibly awesome, plant-based and phthalate-free) candles, but we’ve also expanded to include reed diffusers and fragrances. Milk Jar remains a locally manufactured staple in Canadian apothecary, with stockists across the country.

With your support, we've raised over$469,953$469,953$469,953$469,953$469,953$469,953$469,953$469,953as of November 2025Your Feel Gooder Candle Co. Supporting our communitiesSince 2016 we've donated $1 from every Milk Jar product to non-profits and initiatives that support inclusion.
