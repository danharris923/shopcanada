# Nutracelle

Nutracelle is a Canadian health supplement brand founded by Melanie Wildman after a terrifying incident in which her son stopped breathing from an accidental peanut exposure. That experience drove Wildman to investigate how common allergens are in the food supply — from cross-contamination during manufacturing to raw ingredients processed alongside common allergens — and ultimately to create a line of supplements that families with food allergies could trust completely.

## Allergen-Free Supplements

Nutracelle's core mission is producing supplements that are free from the top allergens that affect millions of Canadians. The product line is free from peanuts, tree nuts, gluten, dairy, soy, eggs, fish, and shellfish — the major allergens that make most supplement shopping a label-reading anxiety exercise for families with food allergies. This allergen-free commitment isn't just about individual ingredients; it extends to manufacturing practices that prevent cross-contamination.

## The Product Line

Nutracelle produces sugar-free vitamin gummies under the Nutramin brand, covering multivitamins, kids' vitamins, sleep support, stress relief, energy boost, and other targeted formulations. The gummies are made without sugar, artificial colours, or artificial flavours, using natural fruit flavours and sweeteners instead. The brand also produces protein supplements and collagen products. Each product is formulated to be inclusive — suitable for people with food allergies, dietary restrictions, and health-conscious preferences.

## A Mother's Mission

Nutracelle is headquartered in Canada, and all products are manufactured with strict quality controls. The brand sells through its online store, Amazon, and select health food retailers. Wildman's personal story — a mother who channeled a frightening experience into a business that protects other families — gives Nutracelle an emotional authenticity that resonates with the allergy community and with parents who want supplements they can give their children without worry.
