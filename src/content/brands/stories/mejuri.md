# Mejuri

Mejuri is a Canadian fine jewellery brand founded in 2015 by Noura Sakkijha in Toronto. The brand disrupted the traditional jewellery industry by selling fine jewellery — real gold, diamonds, and gemstones — directly to consumers at accessible prices, eliminating the massive markups of traditional retail. Mejuri's founding philosophy challenged the idea that fine jewellery is something women should wait to receive as a gift; instead, the brand encourages women to buy jewellery for themselves as an everyday luxury.

## Fine Jewellery, Fair Prices

Mejuri designs and sells 14k and 18k solid gold pieces, sterling silver, diamonds, sapphires, and other precious stones at prices dramatically below traditional jewellers — a pair of gold hoops might run $80 to $200 rather than the $500+ typical of comparable pieces at department store jewellery counters. The brand achieves this through direct-to-consumer sales, cutting out wholesalers and retail middlemen. New collections drop weekly, creating a sense of freshness and discovery that traditional jewellery brands rarely offer.

## The Self-Purchase Revolution

Mejuri helped normalize the idea of women buying fine jewellery for themselves rather than waiting for a partner to gift it. The brand's marketing centres on self-expression, self-reward, and the idea that fine jewellery belongs in everyday life — not locked in a box waiting for special occasions. This message resonated powerfully with millennial and Gen Z women, propelling Mejuri from a Toronto startup to one of the fastest-growing jewellery brands in North America.

## Toronto to the World

Mejuri operates from Toronto and sells through its online store, its own retail showrooms in major cities, and through Sephora. The brand offers a piercing service at many locations, adding experiential retail to its offering. For Canadians who want genuine fine jewellery at honest prices — pieces you can wear every day, buy for yourself, and build into a personal collection — Mejuri redefined what accessible luxury jewellery looks like.
