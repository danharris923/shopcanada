# Aritzia

Brian Hill opened the first Aritzia boutique on Vancouver's South Granville Street in 1984, and four decades later, the company he built is publicly traded on the TSX with annual revenues exceeding $2 billion. That trajectory makes Aritzia one of Canada's most successful fashion stories, full stop.

## The House of Brands Model

What sets Aritzia apart from most retailers is its portfolio of exclusive in-house labels. Rather than selling third-party brands, Aritzia designs and produces almost everything under its own umbrella. Wilfred handles polished, architectural pieces. Babaton covers workwear and tailoring. TNA is the casual and loungewear arm. Sunday Best skews feminine and playful. Tna Butter is all about ultra-soft basics. Each label has its own identity, but they all share Aritzia's emphasis on quality fabrics and clean silhouettes.

## From Vancouver to North America

Aritzia operated exclusively in Canada for its first 23 years before crossing into the United States with a store in New York's SoHo neighbourhood in 2007. The American expansion has been steady and deliberate, with locations now in major cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami. As of 2025, the company runs over 100 stores across North America, with continued growth planned on the U.S. side.

## Canadian Roots, Global Ambitions

Headquarters remain in Vancouver, where Hill still serves as CEO. The company went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2016 and has consistently posted strong growth numbers, fuelled in part by a loyal following on social media. Aritzia's Super Puff jacket became a genuine cultural moment in 2019, selling out repeatedly and generating waitlists in the thousands. The brand has built its reputation not on discounts or sales events but on the strength of its product, which explains why markdowns at Aritzia are rare and closely watched.
