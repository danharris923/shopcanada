# Revolve

Revolve is an American online fashion retailer founded in 2003 in Los Angeles by Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas. The company has grown into one of the largest and most influential online destinations for designer fashion, curating clothing, shoes, bags, and accessories from over 1,000 emerging and established brands. Revolve pioneered the influencer marketing model in fashion e-commerce, building its brand through partnerships with social media personalities and content creators long before most retailers understood the power of the approach.

## Curated Designer Fashion

Revolve functions as a multi-brand retailer, carrying a carefully curated selection from designers ranging from emerging indie labels to well-known names like Free People, Lovers + Friends, and Superdown. The buying team is data-driven, using proprietary analytics to identify trending styles and predict what customers will want before they know it themselves. The result is a selection that feels edited and current rather than overwhelming — shoppers come to Revolve because the hard work of filtering through thousands of brands has already been done for them.

## The Influencer Pioneer

Revolve essentially wrote the playbook for influencer marketing in fashion. The company's Revolve Festival events during Coachella, influencer trips to exotic destinations, and collaborations with creators helped build a brand identity inseparable from social media culture. While other retailers were still running traditional advertising, Revolve was flying influencers to the Maldives and generating organic content that drove millions in sales.

## Shopping Revolve from Canada

Revolve ships to Canada with free 2-day express shipping, displays pricing in CAD, and offers free returns — removing most of the friction that typically comes with cross-border shopping. For Canadian shoppers looking for a curated, trend-forward selection of designer fashion from hundreds of brands in one place, Revolve offers one of the best online shopping experiences available, with the convenience of a domestic retailer.
