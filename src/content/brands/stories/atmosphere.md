# Atmosphere

Atmosphere is a Canadian outdoor specialty retailer that operates as part of the Canadian Tire family of companies under the FGL Sports banner. The stores focus exclusively on outdoor recreation — hiking, camping, climbing, paddling, trail running, snowshoeing, and backcountry skiing — offering gear, apparel, and footwear from leading outdoor brands alongside expert advice for Canadians who take their time outside seriously.

## Gear for the Outdoors

Atmosphere stocks a curated selection of outdoor equipment and apparel from premium brands including The North Face, Arc'teryx, Patagonia, Salomon, Black Diamond, Osprey, and MSR, among others. The product range covers technical outerwear, layering systems, hiking boots, backpacks, tents, sleeping bags, climbing hardware, and water sports equipment. Unlike general sporting goods stores that carry a bit of everything, Atmosphere goes deep in the outdoor category, stocking technical gear alongside entry-level equipment for newcomers to the outdoors.

## Expert Staff

One of Atmosphere's differentiators is its staffing model, which emphasizes hiring people who are active outdoor enthusiasts themselves. Sales staff can speak from personal experience about the gear they sell — recommending a pack based on trails they've hiked, or a tent based on storms they've weathered. This expertise creates a shopping experience closer to a specialty outdoor shop than a chain retailer, despite Atmosphere's corporate backing and multi-location footprint.

## Canada's Outdoor Retailer

Atmosphere operates retail locations across Canada, primarily in urban centres where outdoor enthusiasts are concentrated but may not have access to independent specialty shops. The stores also serve as a resource for trip planning and gear advice, hosting events and clinics during peak outdoor seasons. For Canadians heading into the backcountry or simply outfitting themselves for a weekend car-camping trip, Atmosphere provides the selection and knowledge to gear up properly.
