# Gap

Gap is an American clothing brand founded in 1969 by Donald and Doris Fisher in San Francisco, California. Originally a store selling Levi's jeans and records, Gap evolved into one of the world's largest specialty retailers, defining casual American style for decades. The brand operates a significant Canadian presence through retail stores and its dedicated Canadian e-commerce site at gapcanada.ca, offering men's, women's, and children's clothing with a focus on denim, basics, and wardrobe essentials.

## Denim and Essentials

Gap built its identity around denim — jeans have been the cornerstone of the brand since day one, and the company offers one of the widest ranges of fits, washes, and styles in the market. Beyond denim, Gap is known for its wardrobe basics: t-shirts, button-downs, khakis, sweaters, and outerwear in clean, classic styles. The brand occupies the middle ground between fast fashion and premium, offering well-made staples at moderate prices. Seasonal collections introduce trend-influenced pieces, but the core of Gap's offering remains the everyday essentials that anchor a wardrobe.

## A Brand in Evolution

Gap has navigated significant changes in the retail landscape over the past decade, closing underperforming mall locations while investing in e-commerce and its outlet business. The brand has refreshed its design direction multiple times, working to stay relevant with younger consumers while maintaining the classic appeal that built its customer base. In Canada, Gap continues to operate retail locations in major shopping centres alongside its online store.

## Shopping Gap in Canada

Gap Canada offers Canadian pricing in CAD, Canadian shipping, and easy returns through gapcanada.ca and retail stores across the country. The brand remains a practical shopping destination for Canadian families looking for reliable basics — the kind of store where you can outfit a school-aged child, refresh your own wardrobe staples, and find a decent pair of jeans without overthinking it.
