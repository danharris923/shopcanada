# Bridgehead Coffee

Bridgehead was founded in 1981 in Ottawa as one of Canada's earliest fair-trade coffee pioneers. The company began as a project of Oxfam Canada, importing coffee directly from small-scale farmers in developing countries and selling it through churches, community groups, and eventually its own retail locations. In 2000, Tracey Clark purchased Bridgehead and transformed it from a wholesale fair-trade operation into a full-service specialty coffee roaster and cafe chain, opening the first Bridgehead cafe on Richmond Road in Ottawa.

## Direct Trade and Organic

Bridgehead's sourcing model goes beyond standard fair-trade certification. The company works directly with small-scale farming cooperatives in countries including Guatemala, Peru, Ethiopia, Colombia, and Sumatra, paying premiums above market prices and investing in community development projects in growing regions. All Bridgehead coffee is certified organic and fair-trade, and the company emphasizes full traceability — customers can learn exactly where their coffee came from, who grew it, and how it was processed. This transparency was revolutionary when Bridgehead started and remains a core brand value.

## Ottawa's Coffee Chain

Bridgehead operates approximately a dozen cafes across Ottawa, making it the capital city's homegrown specialty coffee chain. The cafes serve as neighbourhood gathering spots — the kind of places where professors grade papers, local politicians hold meetings, and parents regroup after the school run. The coffee is roasted at Bridgehead's own roastery in Ottawa, and the cafes serve espresso drinks, drip coffee, pastries, sandwiches, and light lunch items. The interior aesthetic is warm and unpretentious, with a focus on comfortable seating and community feel.

## A Local Institution

While Bridgehead has remained a primarily Ottawa-based operation rather than expanding nationally, the brand has become an institution in the capital. Ottawa residents are fiercely loyal to Bridgehead, often preferring it over global chains for both the coffee quality and the company's social mission. The brand also sells its roasted beans online and through select retailers, allowing customers across Canada to access Bridgehead coffee at home. For a mid-size city, Ottawa has an unusually strong independent coffee culture, and Bridgehead deserves significant credit for building it.
