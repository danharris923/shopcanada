# Cineplex

Cineplex is not just Canada's largest movie theatre chain — it is, for all practical purposes, the only one. With roughly 170 theatres and over 1,600 screens across the country, Cineplex Entertainment dominates the Canadian cinema landscape in a way that few companies dominate any industry.

## Built Through Consolidation

The company traces its roots to 1979, when Cineplex Odeon Corporation opened an 18-screen complex inside Toronto's Eaton Centre, then the largest multiplex in the world. The modern version of the company took shape in 2003 when Galaxy Entertainment merged with Loews Cineplex to form Cineplex Galaxy LP, later renamed Cineplex Entertainment. Through a series of acquisitions over the next decade, including AMC's Canadian locations and Empire Theatres' portfolio, Cineplex consolidated its position as the undisputed market leader. The company trades on the TSX under the ticker CGX.

## Beyond the Big Screen

Cineplex has deliberately diversified beyond traditional moviegoing. The Rec Room, its chain of entertainment complexes featuring dining, gaming, and live events, operates in multiple Canadian cities. Playdium, the arcade brand Cineplex acquired, adds another layer. The company also runs Cineplex Store for digital movie sales and rentals, a digital media business that operates screens in malls and office buildings, and the Scene+ loyalty program in partnership with Scotiabank, which has tens of millions of members.

## The Movie Experience

Formats like IMAX, UltraAVX, 4DX, D-BOX, and ScreenX give theatregoers options well beyond the standard screening. VIP Cinemas, featuring reserved seating, in-seat dining, and age-restricted auditoriums, have become a significant revenue driver. Headquartered in Toronto, Cineplex employs around 10,000 people and remains central to how Canadians experience movies, even as streaming has reshaped the entertainment landscape.
