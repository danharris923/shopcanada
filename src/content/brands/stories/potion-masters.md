# Potion Masters

MADE IN CANADA 🇨🇦 Free Shipping on orders over $100. We currently only ship within Canada. The Potion Masters handcraft luxury, award-winning skincare in Canada. Launched in 2019 by Mother-Daughter founders Joy and Sylvan (aka: the original hippy mama, tarot reader extraordinaire and the skincare expert, creative formulation enthusiast).

So, what are we all about and what makes our products so different (and what is this touch of Magic?? ) First, let’s talk waterless beauty. We are beyond passionate about bringing your skin the best that nature and science has to offer in its most concentrated form.

The Potions are made with natural botanicals and with zero extraneous filler ingredients. Many skincare products are made of up to 80% water along with fillers, thickeners, and texture enhancers to give the product substance.

Potions on the other hand, contain ONLY ingredients that serve a purpose for your skin. They are potent, luxurious, and remarkably effective because you are getting the highest quality botanical and research backed (and always cruelty-free) skincare ingredients in their purest form.

Waterless skincare isn’t an entirely new concept. However, The Potion IS an entirely new type of waterless product. Our 100% natural, water-loving oils capture water moisture from your tap, so your skin receives the same hydration as water-based skincare, without water (or preservatives) in the bottle.

Our lack of preservatives paired with our minimalist skincare philosophy, mean that you can leave your skin’s microbiome largely undisturbed. By choosing a waterless product, you do your part to reduce the amount of packaging and transport carbon contributed to by the beauty industry.

Next, let's talk Magic! As if our innovative formulas weren’t magical enough, we believe deeply in the power of intention. That the energy (vibes if you will) that we place into our Potions get carried into the lives of that Potion’s owner.

We meditate over our batches to imbue them with positivity and cast spells to support the energetic intention of each Potion (ex: Sleep, Energy, Peace, Vitality…) We are not about changing the way we look or “fixing” anything that we perceive to be wrong with ourselves.

We are about creating moments of luxury and self appreciation in a hectic world. We are here to support your skin in becoming the best version of YOUR skin. We accept you and love you as you are and hope that when you include a Potion in your self-care rituals, that you feel cared for and and discover your own Magic!
