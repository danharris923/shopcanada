# Organic Traditions

The OTFounding Story Our story It all began with a search for healing Over 30 years ago, our founder Jerry Zeifman struggled with digestive issues until he discovered the power of enzymes. That simple change transformed his health and set him on a lifelong mission: to share nature’s most powerful foods as strategies for wellness, prevention, and vitality.

Organic Traditions grew out of my desire to nourish people with the most nutrient-dense superfoods on the planet. My passion has always been to inspire others to discover a new level of wellness by harnessing the power of traditional foods from around the world.

Jerry Zeifman Founder Rooted in tradition, crafted for today. From Ayurvedic herbs and Japanese tea rituals to Peruvian cacao ceremonies and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Organic Traditions brings ancient wisdom into modern life, making superfoods simple, accessible, and transformative.

A family-led legacy. What began as Jerry’s passion is now carried forward by his daughter Ally, who joined in 2017 to write the next chapter. Since then, we’ve developed 20+ unique blends and expanded Organic Traditions internationally, while staying true to our mission of purity, innovation, and empowerment.

This brand has always been about more than just food—it’s about helping people feel their best every single day. I’m proud to carry forward my father’s vision, while reimagining what superfoods can mean for a new generation.

Ally Mamalider President & Second Gen Founder The next chapter of wellness. For over 25 years, we’ve been Canada’s superfood pioneer. Today, we continue to grow globally, staying true to the same belief that started it all: real food can give you superpowers, every single day.
