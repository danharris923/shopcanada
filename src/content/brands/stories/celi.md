# CELI

CELI is a Canadian fine jewellery brand founded by Chau and Trang, two women who share a passion for storytelling through design. The brand was created with the belief that every moment in life deserves to be celebrated — from major milestones like engagements and graduations to the quiet, personal victories that only you know about. CELI specializes in solid gold jewellery that's meant to be worn every day as a constant reminder of the moments and people that matter most.

## Solid Gold, Real Stories

CELI's collection centres on solid gold pieces — primarily 14k and 18k gold — rather than gold-plated or vermeil alternatives. This is a deliberate choice: solid gold doesn't tarnish, fade, or wear away, making it suitable for pieces intended to be worn daily for years or even passed down through generations. The designs are refined and minimal, ranging from delicate chains and small pendants to stackable rings and personalized pieces. Each item is designed to layer and combine, allowing customers to build a personal collection over time.

## Personalization and Meaning

What distinguishes CELI from many jewellery brands is the emphasis on personal significance. The brand offers engraving, birthstone customization, and initial pieces that allow customers to encode personal meaning into their jewellery. Pieces are often purchased to mark specific life moments — a new baby, a career achievement, a relationship milestone — and the brand encourages customers to attach their own stories to what they wear. This approach transforms jewellery from decoration into personal archive.

## Canadian Craftsmanship

CELI sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The brand has built a following among Canadian women who want fine jewellery that's meaningful, well-made, and designed for everyday life rather than special occasions only. For customers who believe their jewellery should carry as much personal weight as the moments it represents, CELI offers pieces worthy of the stories they hold.
