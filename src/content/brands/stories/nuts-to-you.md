# Nuts To You

Nuts To You Nut Butter is a Canadian company that has been producing natural and organic nut and seed butters since the 1990s, operating out of a production facility in Ontario. The brand started with a simple premise: make nut butters using only nuts — no added oils, sugars, salt, or preservatives. This single-ingredient approach was unusual at the time, when most commercial peanut butters contained hydrogenated oils and sugar, and it attracted health-conscious consumers looking for a cleaner alternative.

## The Range

Nuts To You produces an extensive lineup of nut and seed butters that goes well beyond peanut butter. The catalogue includes almond butter, cashew butter, tahini (sesame seed butter), sunflower seed butter, hazelnut butter, macadamia nut butter, and the brand's newest addition, pistachio butter. Each variety is available in smooth and crunchy textures, and the organic versions use certified organic nuts. The raw nut butters are made from unroasted nuts, preserving more nutrients, while the roasted versions offer deeper flavour profiles. All products are made in small batches.

## Organic and Natural

Nuts To You was an early adopter of organic certification in the Canadian nut butter market. The brand's organic line uses certified organic nuts sourced from farms that meet strict agricultural standards. Even the non-organic products maintain the brand's commitment to minimal ingredients — typically just the nut itself, with some varieties offering a lightly salted option. The products are naturally gluten-free, and several varieties are suitable for people with peanut allergies (the tree nut and seed butters are produced with care to minimize cross-contamination).

## A Canadian Pantry Staple

Nuts To You products are available at natural food stores, grocery retailers, and online across Canada. The brand is a regular feature in the organic and health food aisles of stores like Whole Foods, organic co-ops, and independent health food shops. In the Canadian nut butter market — which has expanded dramatically as consumers seek alternatives to conventional peanut butter — Nuts To You has maintained its position by sticking to the formula that built its reputation: real nuts, nothing else.
