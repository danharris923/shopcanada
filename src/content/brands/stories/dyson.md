# Dyson

Dyson is a British technology company founded in 1991 by Sir James Dyson, who spent five years and built 5,127 prototypes before perfecting his bagless cyclone vacuum cleaner — a product that every major manufacturer had rejected. The company has since grown from a vacuum maker into a global technology firm that designs and manufactures hair care tools, air purifiers, fans, heaters, and lighting, all built around Dyson's core competency: high-speed digital motors and airflow engineering.

## Engineering-Led Products

Every Dyson product starts with an engineering problem rather than a marketing brief. The company's cordless vacuums use its proprietary digital motors — spinning at up to 125,000 RPM — to generate suction power that rivals corded machines in a battery-powered format. The Supersonic hair dryer and Airwrap styler used the same motor technology to revolutionize hair care, delivering controlled airflow that dries and styles hair faster with less heat damage. Air purifiers use HEPA filtration and sealed systems to capture particles as small as allergens and viruses.

## The Dyson Difference

Dyson products are unmistakable — the industrial design is bold, futuristic, and unlike anything else on the shelf. This distinctive approach is deliberate: Dyson views design as inseparable from engineering, and the form of every product reflects its function. The company invests heavily in R&D, employing thousands of engineers and scientists across research centres worldwide. This engineering focus commands premium prices, but Dyson's argument is that the performance, longevity, and innovation justify the investment.

## Dyson in Canada

Dyson operates a Canadian website at dyson.com/en-CA with CAD pricing and local shipping, alongside presence in major Canadian retailers. The brand offers Canadian-specific customer support and warranty service. For Canadians willing to invest in home technology that genuinely performs at a higher level — whether that's a vacuum that makes cleaning easier, a hair dryer that cuts styling time in half, or an air purifier that actually cleans the air — Dyson delivers engineering that justifies its price tag.
