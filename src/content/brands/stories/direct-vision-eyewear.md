Buying Quality EyeWear Should Be Easy and Affordable Together, the two of them founded Direct Vision, a 100% Canadian Company focused on crafting quality, stylish, and affordable eye wear with state of the art lenses.

Because everyone deserves excellent vision. It was 2017 when Joey, a student in the MBA Program at McMaster University, started to notice some eyestrain at his computer. He went to his optometrist and to his immense surprise (and mild dread) he was told he needed glasses!

Being someone with good vision his whole life, he had no idea of what kind of eyeglasses to get, where to get the glasses, or how much he should be spending for good quality frames and lenses. After speaking with his classmates, friends, and doing his own research online, Joey became frustrated by the lack of affordable and high quality options for students like himself: on a budget but still wanting to see their very best.

It seemed that most of the time in order to hit a certain price point, the optical quality of the lenses, sturdiness of the frames, or warranty options were sacrificed. After doing even more digging, Joey discovered that many of the “unique” online optical options out there were owned by the same large corporations.

There were very few “truly Canadian” online eyewear companies, and supporting local Canadian businesses was very important to Joey. Joey spoke of his concerns to his cousin Kyle, who had recently graduated with a business certificate from Loyalist College and had experience in the optical industry.

Joey and Kyle researched what their friends, family and classmates found important when shopping for eyewear. Three main components seemed to stand out: style, quality, and affordability. How we do it At Direct Vision, frames and lenses are what we do best.
