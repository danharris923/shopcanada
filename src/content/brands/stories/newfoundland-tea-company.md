# The Newfoundland Tea Company

The Newfoundland Tea Company is a Canadian tea brand rooted in the culture, warmth, and hospitality of Newfoundland and Labrador. The company grew out of a small inn and bistro in Gambo, Newfoundland, where the founders discovered that a great cup of tea was central to the way Newfoundlanders connect — over kitchen tables, at the door of a neighbour's house, and during the long winter evenings that define island life. The brand is now based in Gander and has grown from that small bistro into a beloved tea company shipping across Canada.

## Organic Loose Leaf Blends

The Newfoundland Tea Company produces organic loose leaf tea blends inspired by the flavours and character of the island. The collection includes traditional black teas, herbal infusions, and signature blends with names and flavours that reflect Newfoundland culture. Ingredients are sourced for quality and certified organic, and blends are crafted to deliver genuine flavour rather than the dusty, mass-produced taste of commercial tea bags. The loose leaf format allows the full leaves to unfurl and release their complete flavour profile.

## More Than Tea

Beyond tea, the company operates as a curated gift shop offering local and vintage goods, pottery, gift boxes, and other items that capture the spirit of Newfoundland. Curated gift boxes that pair tea with locally made treats and keepsakes have become popular for holidays, care packages, and special occasions. The brand serves as a gateway to Newfoundland culture for Canadians across the country who may never visit the island but can experience its warmth through a well-made cup of tea.

## From Gambo to Your Cup

The Newfoundland Tea Company sells through its online store in Gander and ships across Canada. The brand has built a following among tea lovers who appreciate organic quality, and among the Newfoundland diaspora who find a taste of home in every cup. For Canadians who want their tea with character, community, and a strong connection to place, the Newfoundland Tea Company delivers something that grocery store tea simply cannot.
