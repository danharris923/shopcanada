# Phil Sebastian Coffee Roasters

In specialty coffee, there’s no shortage of “world’s best” roaster lists. Most of them are built on reputation, social reach, or popularity. That’s fine, but for us, the real test has always been how a coffee tastes in the cup, with no preconceived notions attached. That’s why the Global Coffee Awards caught our eye. It’s a blind competition that evaluates every coffee on a level playing field, judged purely on quality. No branding, no bias, just coffee. There aren’t many competitions like this in the world, which makes it all the more exciting. This was the first year of the event, with thousands of coffees entered from across Canada and the U.S. From that massive and talented field, we’re humbled and proud that our coffees stood out. Our Jose Joaquin Bolaños Geisha has been awarded a Gold Medal in the Filter/Washed Category at the Global Coffee Awards US & Canada, 2025! Sharing the news with Jose Joaquin was a special moment for us, marking the culmination of years of dedication, experimentation, and exceptional craftsmanship on his part. This coffee is available for a limited time, and can be found here. Our Candy Cloud Espresso, featuring Bekele Yutute Natural, also made a strong showing: • Silver Medal in Espresso – Single Origin/Experimental Processing • Silver Medal in Flat White / Alternative Milk • Finalist in Flat White / Dairy Milk We rounded out the competition with additional Finalist placements: • Espresso / Decaf – Lights Out Decaf • Filter – Single Origin / Traditional Processing – Lilac Dream, featuring coffee from the Danche (Gerba Dogo) site in Ethiopia. This recognition highlights both our team’s work and the incredible quality delivered by our producing partners. We’re thrilled with how our coffees performed.
