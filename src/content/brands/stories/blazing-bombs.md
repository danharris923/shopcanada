# Blazing Bombs

Blazing Bombs is a Canadian bath and body care brand that started in 2015 as a basement hobby by a former full-time nurse with a passion for vibrant scents, bold colours, and the idea that bath time should be an experience rather than a routine. What began with handmade bath bombs given as gifts to friends and family grew into a full studio operation and thriving small business. The brand is known for its playful, candy-inspired aesthetic — bath bombs that look as fun as they smell, with swirls of colour, sprinkles, and creative shapes.

## The Products

Blazing Bombs' core lineup features bath bombs in an enormous variety of scents, colours, and designs. From classic lavender and eucalyptus to creative combinations like cotton candy, birthday cake, and tropical fruit, the range covers every mood and preference. Beyond bath bombs, the brand has expanded into shower steamers, bubble bars, body scrubs, bath salts, and skincare products. The products use skin-safe colours, moisturizing ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter, and fragrance oils that transform an ordinary bath into a sensory experience.

## Handmade in Canada

Every Blazing Bombs product is handmade in the brand's Canadian studio. The small-batch production allows for quality control and the creative freedom to develop new products, seasonal collections, and limited-edition releases. The founder's nursing background informs the ingredient choices — an understanding of skin sensitivity and the importance of using body-safe ingredients. Products are formulated without harsh chemicals, and the brand is transparent about ingredients and potential allergens.

## A Growing Community

Blazing Bombs sells through its online store and at local markets and pop-up events. The brand has built a loyal community through social media, where colourful bath bomb demonstrations and product reveals generate excitement for new releases. The business represents a growing category of Canadian small-batch beauty brands that compete on creativity, quality, and personal connection rather than mass-market scale.
