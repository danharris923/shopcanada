The Story of the UGG Brand In the late 1970s, Brian Smith was a hardworking accounting student living in Australia with a deep passion for surfing, music, and meditation.

One day, he heard an introspective song on the radio, which sparked an idea to change his life, abandon his corporate career, and travel to California. When he arrived in Southern California, he was inspired by the sense of freedom and the countercultural surf scene.

He noticed his surfer friends didn’t wear sheepskin boots like Australians did after chilly morning surf sessions. This was when his idea for the UGG brand was born. Brian worked tirelessly to bring his bold and distinctive idea to life.

On his first sales trips, he went door-to-door to over 150 shops in SoCal, but they all turned him down, saying his product would never work next to flip-flops and board shorts. Brian didn’t give up; he decided to sell his boots pop-up-style from the back of his van while wearing them at Malibu Point Beach.

His approach was grassroots and simple: word of mouth helped folks line up to shop under the California sun. They quickly became the next big thing; even shop owners and big retailers clamored to get their hands on them.

Within a decade, Hollywood took notice, and celebrities wore UGG brand products on red carpets and in paparazzi shots. The brand Brian Smith created became so popular that he began looking for a company to take it even further.

In 1995, Brian connected with the California company Deckers Brands, and we’ve taken the UGG brand worldwide with the same dedication to quality and craftsmanship that’s been with the brand since the beginning.

The UGG brand has committed to crafting enduring products and experiences, drawing on the original craftsmanship while modernizing them to meet the needs of our global consumers. We’ve innovated from our early days with new bold designs, extended wearing occasions, and material innovations – and more.

Our origin story energizes us today, reminding us that our brand embodies creativity, distinctiveness, and a rebellious spirit. The Story of the UGG Brand In the late 1970s, Brian Smith was a hardworking accounting student living in Australia with a deep passion for surfing, music, and meditation.
