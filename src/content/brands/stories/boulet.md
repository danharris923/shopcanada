# Boulet

The Boulet family began making boots in 1933 in Saint-Tite, Quebec, a small town in the Mauricie region that would become synonymous with western culture in Canada. What started as a modest leather workshop has grown into Canada's oldest and largest western boot manufacturer, with four generations of the Boulet family guiding the company. The factory in Saint-Tite still produces every pair, employing hundreds of local workers in a town of fewer than 4,000 people.

## Saint-Tite and the Western Connection

Saint-Tite hosts the Festival Western de Saint-Tite every September, one of the largest western festivals in Eastern Canada, drawing over 600,000 visitors annually. Boulet's deep roots in this community are no coincidence — the company helped shape the town's identity as a western culture hub. The festival features rodeo competitions, country music, and cowboy culture, and Boulet boots are everywhere. This connection gives the brand an authenticity in the western market that cannot be manufactured through marketing alone.

## Craftsmanship and Range

Boulet produces over 700 styles of boots, from traditional cowboy boots with pointed toes and walking heels to CSA-certified work boots built for construction sites, farms, and oil fields. The company uses a combination of Goodyear welt and cement construction depending on the boot's purpose, and sources leathers ranging from cowhide and bison to exotic skins. Each pair goes through over 200 individual steps during manufacturing. The brand also produces boots under the Old West, Boulet Challenger, and HillBilly brands to cover different market segments.

## Still Canadian, Still Family

While many North American boot manufacturers have moved production to Mexico or Asia, Boulet has kept its entire operation in Saint-Tite. The company exports to the United States and internationally, competing with American brands like Ariat and Justin on quality while maintaining the distinction of being genuinely Canadian-made. The Boulet family's commitment to their hometown and their craft has made the brand a point of pride for Quebec and for Canadian manufacturing as a whole.
