# Chatters Hair Salon

Chatters is Canada's largest hair salon chain, operating over 115 locations coast to coast with a team of more than 1,200 hair stylists and consultants. Headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, with a 26,000-square-foot distribution centre in Red Deer, Alberta, Chatters combines salon services with one of the country's largest selections of professional hair care products — making it both a place to get your hair done and a destination for salon-quality products to take home.

## Salon and Retail

Chatters operates as a dual-concept business: full-service hair salons offering cuts, colour, treatments, and styling, alongside an extensive retail floor stocking professional hair care products from over 70 brands. The product lineup includes Redken, Moroccanoil, Olaplex, Drybar, Pureology, Paul Mitchell, Matrix, Joico, and dozens more — brands typically only available in salons or specialty beauty stores. This combination means customers can get their hair styled by a professional and buy the exact products their stylist used, all in one visit.

## Inclusive and Sustainable

Chatters offers a genderless, inclusive service menu where haircut pricing is based on hair length and service time rather than gender — a progressive approach that eliminates the "pink tax" common in many salons. The company has also partnered with Green Circle Salons to divert up to 95% of salon waste from landfills, turning hair clippings, foils, and other beauty waste into sustainable materials. The Style Consciously program helps customers identify products that are clean, cruelty-free, vegan, or sustainable.

## Canada's Hair Destination

Chatters locations are found in malls and shopping centres across Canada, and the company also operates an online store for product purchases. For Canadians looking for professional hair services backed by expert product knowledge, or simply shopping for salon-quality hair care with guidance from trained consultants, Chatters delivers both under one roof at over 115 locations nationwide.
