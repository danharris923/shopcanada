# New Balance

New Balance is an American athletic footwear and apparel company founded in 1906 in Boston, Massachusetts, by William J. Riley. Originally a company that made arch supports for people with foot problems, New Balance evolved into one of the world's most respected running shoe brands, known for its commitment to fit, performance, and the distinction of manufacturing some of its shoes in the United States and United Kingdom — a rarity in an industry that has almost entirely offshored production.

## Performance and Fit

New Balance built its reputation on the idea that fit matters more than flash. The brand offers shoes in multiple widths — from narrow to extra-wide — a practice that most competitors abandoned decades ago. The running shoe line covers everything from lightweight racing flats to maximum-cushion daily trainers, with the Fresh Foam and FuelCell lines representing the brand's current performance technology. Beyond running, New Balance produces training shoes, walking shoes, basketball shoes, and lifestyle sneakers.

## From Dad Shoe to Fashion Icon

New Balance experienced a remarkable cultural transformation in the 2010s and 2020s. The brand's classic silhouettes — particularly the 574, 990, and 550 models — went from being mocked as "dad shoes" to becoming some of the most coveted sneakers in streetwear and fashion. Collaborations with designers like JJJJound, Aimé Leon Dore, and Joe Freshgoods transformed New Balance into a fashion brand with athletic credibility, rather than simply an athletic brand that fashion borrowed.

## New Balance in Canada

New Balance operates a full Canadian e-commerce site at newbalance.ca with CAD pricing and local shipping. The brand is also available at footwear retailers, sporting goods stores, and select fashion boutiques across Canada. For Canadians who want athletic shoes that prioritize fit and performance, or fashion-forward sneakers with genuine heritage behind them, New Balance delivers on both fronts with a credibility that trend-chasing competitors can't replicate.
