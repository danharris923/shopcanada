# EQ3

EQ3 was established in 2001 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a modern furniture company that designs, manufactures, and retails contemporary home furnishings. The brand grew out of Palliser Furniture, one of Canada's largest upholstered furniture manufacturers, which has been operating in Winnipeg since 1944. EQ3 was created as a direct-to-consumer brand that could bring Palliser's manufacturing capabilities to a design-forward audience that wanted clean, modern furniture without the premium price tags of European design houses.

## Designed and Made in Canada

A significant portion of EQ3's upholstered furniture — sofas, sectionals, chairs, and beds — is manufactured at the company's factory in Winnipeg. This Canadian manufacturing capability allows for a made-to-order model where customers can choose from hundreds of fabric and leather options, with sofas built to their specifications and delivered within weeks rather than the months-long waits common with imported furniture. The Winnipeg factory employs skilled craftspeople who build each piece by hand, a manufacturing approach that supports quality control and customization.

## The Design Aesthetic

EQ3's design language is clean, contemporary, and restrained. The furniture favours simple lines, honest materials, and neutral palettes that work in a range of interior styles. Collections span living room, bedroom, dining, and home office categories, with occasional collaborations with Canadian and international designers. Beyond furniture, EQ3 sells rugs, lighting, décor, and accessories that complement the core collections. The brand occupies the sweet spot between IKEA and high-end designer furniture — better quality and design than mass market, but more accessible than luxury.

## Showrooms and Online

EQ3 operates showrooms in major Canadian cities including Winnipeg, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, and Ottawa, as well as locations in the United States. The showrooms serve as both retail spaces and design consultation centres where customers can touch fabrics, test comfort, and work with staff to configure custom orders. The online store allows customers to browse the full catalogue and order directly. EQ3 has built a reputation among Canadian homeowners and designers as a reliable source for well-designed, well-made furniture that doesn't require a luxury budget.
