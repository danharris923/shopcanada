# Clever Mocktails

Clever Mocktails is a Canadian non-alcoholic beverage brand that produces ready-to-drink mocktails designed to replicate the experience of a craft cocktail without the alcohol. The company recognized that the growing sober-curious movement and demand for sophisticated non-alcoholic options was creating a gap in the Canadian market — most existing options were either sugary sodas, basic juice mixes, or expensive imported products. Clever set out to create mocktails that are genuinely enjoyable as a drink choice, not just a consolation prize for the designated driver.

## The Cocktail Experience, Minus the Alcohol

Clever Mocktails are formulated to capture the complexity of classic cocktails — the bittersweet notes of a gin and tonic, the bright acidity of a margarita, the herbaceous depth of a mojito. The recipes use botanical extracts, natural flavours, citrus juices, and carbonation to create drinks that have layered flavour profiles rather than the one-dimensional sweetness that characterizes most non-alcoholic beverages. The drinks are low in sugar and calories compared to traditional cocktails, making them a genuinely lighter option rather than a sugar bomb dressed up as a health choice.

## The Range

Clever produces several varieties inspired by classic cocktails, each packaged in slim cans that are designed for convenience — easy to bring to a dinner party, pack in a cooler, or stock in the fridge for a weeknight treat. The branding is clean and contemporary, deliberately avoiding the tongue-in-cheek "fake alcohol" aesthetic that some mocktail brands adopt. Clever wants its products to stand on their own as great drinks, not as substitutes.

## Part of the Movement

Clever Mocktails is available at select grocery retailers, liquor stores (many Canadian liquor stores now carry non-alcoholic options), and online across Canada. The brand has grown alongside the broader cultural shift away from alcohol-centric socializing, particularly among younger Canadians who are drinking less than previous generations. For hosts, restaurants, and anyone who wants a sophisticated drink option without alcohol, Clever offers a product that doesn't require an explanation or an apology.
