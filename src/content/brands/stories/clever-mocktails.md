Skip to content Facebook Instagram TikTok YouTube ✨ FREE SHIPPING 📦 ✨ OUR STORY How are non-alcoholic drinks made?Uncover the secrets of our Clever products, crafted in Canada, and learn about our unique production processes.We select the finest botanicals and meticulously source them.Botanicals are the herbs, spices, fruits, and fruit peels, that give our mocktails and non-alcoholic gin their unique flavours.We artisanally infuse and then distill these botanical extracts in an authentic copper still to capture all their bright and vibrant flavours. We only distill in small batches, adding just the right quantity of botanicals. We need a lot of botanical extracts to get the layered complexity and mouth feel of a regular cocktail without the alcohol.The result is a refined, refreshing, non-alcoholic drink that doesn't ask you to compromise on taste, with no downsides of alcohol. Our mocktails are the non-alcoholic drinks to celebrate anytime and keep your mind and body safe.Enjoy!
