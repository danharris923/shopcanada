# UNDZ

UNDZ is a Montreal-based underwear brand that launched with a mission to make basics fun. The company takes a category that most brands treat as an afterthought — everyday underwear — and injects it with personality through bold prints, pop culture references, and playful patterns that range from pizza slices and flamingos to hockey themes and seasonal designs. The brand produces underwear for men, women, and kids, all manufactured with a focus on comfort, fit, and fabrics that hold up wash after wash.

## The Prints

What sets UNDZ apart from conventional underwear brands is the sheer creativity of its print designs. New collections drop regularly, often tied to seasons, holidays, or cultural moments. The design team in Montreal develops original artwork for each collection, resulting in prints that feel like limited-edition releases rather than basic underwear. This approach has turned underwear into a gift-worthy, collectible product — customers buy multiple pairs to build a rotation of fun patterns, and the brand has become a popular choice for stocking stuffers and birthday gifts.

## Quality and Comfort

Beneath the playful exterior, UNDZ takes the technical side of underwear seriously. The brand uses premium modal, cotton, and microfibre fabrics chosen for softness, breathability, and moisture management. The fit is designed to be comfortable for all-day wear without riding up or losing shape. Men's styles include boxer briefs, briefs, and trunks, while women's options cover bikini, boyshort, and thong styles. Kids' designs match the same fun aesthetic with age-appropriate prints and durable construction.

## Made in Montreal

UNDZ is proudly designed and headquartered in Montreal, contributing to the city's vibrant fashion and design scene. The brand sells through its online shop, offering free shipping across Canada, and is also carried by select retailers. UNDZ has built a loyal following by proving that everyday basics don't have to be boring — and that a small Canadian brand can compete with global underwear giants by offering something genuinely different.
