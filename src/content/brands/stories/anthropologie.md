# Anthropologie

Anthropologie is an American lifestyle brand founded in 1992 by Dick Hayne, who also founded Urban Outfitters. Headquartered in Philadelphia, the brand creates a distinctive world of bohemian-inspired women's fashion, home decor, furniture, beauty products, and gifts — all curated with an artistic, eclectic sensibility that sets it apart from conventional department stores. Anthropologie stores are designed as immersive experiences, with visual merchandising so elaborate that each location feels more like an art installation than a retail shop.

## Fashion and Home

Anthropologie's fashion line features flowing dresses, textured knitwear, printed blouses, and relaxed separates with a romantic, bohemian-inflected aesthetic. The clothing tends toward rich colours, interesting textures, and artisanal details that feel special without being costume-like. The home collection is equally distinctive: hand-painted mugs, unique cabinet knobs, embroidered pillows, and furniture pieces with character. The brand has a knack for finding or creating products that feel like one-of-a-kind discoveries, even when they're produced at retail scale.

## The Anthropologie Experience

Shopping at Anthropologie — whether in store or online — is designed to feel like wandering through a beautifully curated boutique rather than a corporate retail chain. The stores are individually designed with local art, custom fixtures, and seasonal displays that change regularly. This attention to experience has earned Anthropologie a devoted customer base of women who shop the brand not just for specific items but for the pleasure of the browse itself.

## Anthropologie in Canada

Anthropologie ships to Canada through its website, with import fees calculated at checkout so there are no surprises on delivery. The brand doesn't operate standalone Canadian stores but has built a loyal Canadian following through its e-commerce presence. For Canadians who appreciate fashion and home goods with artistic sensibility and bohemian charm, Anthropologie offers a shopping experience that feels like a curated treasure hunt.
