# Stacked Pancake House

OURMISSIONStacked Pancake & Breakfast House has a rich history rooted in Canadian culture. Since our founding in 2016, we are committed to innovating and delivering the best customer experience in breakfast for our communities.

OURVISIONTo become Canada’s favourite breakfast spot from coast-to-coast, delivering fresh takes on classic dishes, genuine hospitality, and a space where everyone feels welcome. ABOUT USEarly 1980sThe BeginningOur story starts in Barrie, Ontario, with the Country Kettle Family Restaurant, opened by Terry Taylor.

A cozy, welcoming spot where breakfast and lunch brought people together. 1987Building YearsIn 1987, the restaurant was passed on to Ravi & Rekha Narang, who partnered with the Mehra family, continuing to build a place rooted in good food and community.

2016First Stacked Is OpenedWith a fresh idea and a lot of heart, Manish Mehra (now our CEO and Director) reimagined the family restaurant and opened the first Stacked Pancake & Breakfast House—inspired by the classics, but with a modern twist.

2018Franchising BeginsWe took a big step and opened our first franchised location in Orangeville, Ontario. By the end of the year, there were 5 Stacked locations. 2023National ExpansionWe saw many years of steady growth—we grew to 65 stores and focused on growth in provinces outside of Ontario.

Our goal remained the same; bringing more Stacked breakfasts to more communities. 2024Corporate & Franchised GrowthBy the end of the year, 36 new locations had opened—our biggest year yet celebrating opening 100 stores across Canada—truly making us a Canadian favourite.

Our corporate team more than tripled, with a focus on Culinary, Marketing and Operations. 2025 What's AheadWe’re starting the year with a new headquarters and test kitchen—a space for collaboration, creativity, and growth.

Continued GrowthServing Canadian Families EverywhereWith plans to open a new store every week, we’re excited (and grateful) to keep growing, one community at a time. JOIN STAC...
