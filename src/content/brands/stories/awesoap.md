# Awesoap

OUR SOAPY STORYHi I'm Kat—the maker behind aweSOAP! ​ My journey to soapmaking wasn’t exactly typical. I started out as a biotechnologist, working in chemical and food manufacturing, but over time, I realized I wanted something different. I wanted to create clean, natural products—something truly good for the skin, free from harmful chemicals, and made with intention. What began as a passion project in my kitchen quickly grew into aweSOAP, a brand dedicated to beautiful, effective, and non-toxic soaps, candles, and skincare. Every product I make is a blend of science, nature, and artistry, using premium ingredients, natural colorants, and pure essential oils to craft something special. But aweSOAP isn't just my business—it's a family effort. My loved ones have been by my side every step of the way, from testing products to helping with packaging and markets. Their support and encouragement fuel my passion, making aweSOAP more than just a brand—it's a reflection of the love and care we put into everything we create. ​ Now, three years in, aweSOAP has become more than just a business—it’s a way for me to share my love for high-quality, skin-loving products with people who care about what they put on their bodies. Whether it’s a bar of soap infused with botanicals or a candle that fills a space with warmth, every item is made with passion, integrity, and a whole lot of love! Thanks for being here and supporting my journey—I can’t wait for you to experience aweSOAP! ​ With gratitude, Kat
