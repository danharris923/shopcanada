# Wolf Circus

Fiona Morrison founded Wolf Circus in 2012 in Vancouver, British Columbia, starting with a small collection of hand-carved wax pieces that she cast into silver and bronze jewellery from her apartment. The brand name came from a desire to pair something wild with something structured — a philosophy that shows up in the designs, which balance organic shapes with clean lines. What began as a one-woman operation selling at local markets has grown into an internationally recognized demi-fine jewellery brand.

## Recycled Metals and Responsible Materials

Wolf Circus built its identity around sustainable production long before it became an industry expectation. The brand uses recycled sterling silver and recycled 14k gold vermeil for its collections, reducing the demand for newly mined metals. Cultured freshwater pearls replace wild-harvested ones, and packaging is made from recycled and recyclable materials. The brand is certified as a B Corporation, meeting verified standards for social and environmental performance. This commitment to responsible sourcing resonates with a customer base that wants beautiful jewellery without the ethical compromise.

## The Demi-Fine Sweet Spot

Wolf Circus occupies the demi-fine category — above costume jewellery in quality and materials, but priced below traditional fine jewellery. Most pieces range from $60 to $300 CAD, making them accessible for everyday wear and gift-giving while using materials that won't tarnish or turn green after a few wears. The collections include rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, with signature pieces featuring bold sculptural shapes, chunky chains, and organic textures inspired by nature and architecture.

## From Vancouver to the World

Wolf Circus jewellery is now carried in over 200 retail locations internationally, including stockists in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The brand sells direct through its online store and has been featured in publications including Vogue, Elle, and Forbes. Despite the growth, design and production oversight remain in Vancouver, where Morrison and her team develop each collection from concept through final quality checks.
