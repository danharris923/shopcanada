# Iron Vegan

Iron Vegan is a Canadian plant-based sports nutrition brand that launched to challenge the assumption that serious athletic performance requires animal-based protein. The brand is part of the SierraSil Health family of companies, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Iron Vegan was built for athletes and active individuals who want high-performance supplements made entirely from plant-based, organic, non-GMO ingredients — without the bloating, digestive issues, and ethical concerns that come with whey and casein protein.

## Sprouted Protein

Iron Vegan's signature innovation is its use of sprouted brown rice protein as a primary protein source. Sprouting activates enzymes in the grain that improve nutrient bioavailability and digestibility, resulting in a plant protein that absorbs more efficiently than conventional plant-based alternatives. The Sprouted Protein line delivers 22+ grams of complete protein per serving with all essential amino acids, a full BCAA profile, and added digestive enzymes. The texture and mixability are notably smoother than many plant proteins, addressing one of the biggest complaints consumers have about the category.

## The Product Line

Beyond protein powders, Iron Vegan produces Athlete's Blend (a multi-source plant protein combining pea, rice, and pumpkin seed proteins), Athlete's Gainer (a high-calorie plant-based mass gainer), and performance bars. The brand also offers a greens powder and supplementary products for pre-workout energy and recovery. Every product is certified organic, non-GMO, soy-free, gluten-free, and free from artificial colours, flavours, and sweeteners. The formulations are third-party tested and manufactured in a GMP-certified Canadian facility.

## For Athletes, By Design

Iron Vegan products are available at health food stores, supplement retailers, and online across Canada. The brand has particularly strong distribution through natural health chains and is a fixture in the plant-based section of stores like Whole Foods, Nature's Fare, and independent health food shops. Iron Vegan has built credibility with serious athletes — not just lifestyle vegans — by delivering supplements that perform at the level demanded by competitive training and recovery.
