Our Story The Designer Meet Anne Seeking a medium for her creativity, Toronto-born artist Anne Sportun began making jewellery as a teenager. She deferred her archeological studies to enroll in a jewellery arts programme where she acquired her formal goldsmithing skills. Anne founded her brand with the opening of her first atelier in the late 1980’s. This was the beginning of a prolific career which continues to evolve. Carrying on the legacy Meet Haley For her daughter Haley, jewellery has been a lifelong inspiration, nurtured by her mother's creativity. Surrounded by the beauty and passion that defined Anne's collections, Haley found herself drawn into the world of fine jewellery by working in the retail store and at trade shows. She admired her mother's craftsmanship and the stories woven into each piece, sparking a curiosity and deepening her interest in the business.Anne entrusted Haley with more responsibilities working with clients for bespoke jewellery including the cherished task of crafting one-of-a-kind engagement rings, a testament to Haley's growing expertise and commitment to excellence. A Mother Daughter Duo Today, Anne and Haley stand together as co-owners of Anne Sportun Fine Jewellery, blending their distinct talents and shared passion for design. Together, they embark on a collaborative journey, drawing inspiration from nature and each other's ideas to create core collections that reflect their combined vision.
