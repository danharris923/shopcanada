# Milestones

Milestones Grill + Bar opened its first location in 1989 in Toronto, positioning itself in the upscale casual dining space that was emerging in Canada at the time. The concept targeted adults looking for a polished restaurant experience with chef-driven food, creative cocktails, and contemporary design, all at prices that were accessible for a weeknight dinner or weekend celebration.

## Part of the Recipe Unlimited Family

Milestones is owned by Recipe Unlimited Corporation (formerly Cara Operations), one of Canada's largest restaurant companies. Recipe's portfolio includes Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, The Keg, Montana's, Kelsey's, and several other brands. Within this family, Milestones occupies the upper end of the casual dining spectrum, competing directly with Earls, Cactus Club, and Joey for the urban professional demographic. The Recipe backing gives Milestones access to shared supply chain, real estate, and operational expertise.

## The Menu and Experience

Milestones' menu draws from global cuisines, with dishes ranging from sushi bowls and Thai curry to steaks, pastas, and brunch offerings. The brand refreshes its menu seasonally and invests in chef-developed recipes that aim for restaurant quality without fine dining pretension. Cocktail programs feature house-made syrups and fresh ingredients, and the wine list is curated rather than encyclopedic. The restaurants are typically designed with warm lighting, booth seating, and patio space, creating an atmosphere that works equally well for business lunches and date nights.

## Across Canada

Milestones operates approximately 50 locations across Canada, concentrated in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta. The brand has found its niche in suburban power centres and downtown locations where foot traffic supports the lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch crowds that form its customer base. While the Canadian casual dining market is competitive and has been pressured by rising costs, Milestones has maintained its position by consistently delivering a reliable experience.
