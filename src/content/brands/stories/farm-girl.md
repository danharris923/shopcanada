# Farm Girl

Farm Girl is a Toronto-based food company that makes keto-friendly and low-carb versions of breakfast staples that most diet plans force people to abandon: cereal, granola, and baking mixes. The brand was founded by a team that recognized a gap in the Canadian market — people following keto, low-carb, or grain-free diets were missing the simple pleasure of a bowl of cereal in the morning or a homemade muffin with their coffee. Farm Girl set out to bring those comfort foods back without the sugar and carbohydrate load.

## The Products

Farm Girl's core lineup includes nut-based cereals and granolas that use almonds, pecans, coconut, and seeds as the base instead of oats or wheat. The cereals are designed to be eaten with milk just like traditional cereal, but with a fraction of the carbohydrates — typically 2-4 grams of net carbs per serving. The granola works as a snack, yogurt topping, or breakfast base. The brand also produces baking mixes for pancakes, waffles, muffins, and cookies that use almond flour and coconut flour, allowing keto followers to bake at home without the trial and error of developing their own recipes.

## Clean Ingredients

Farm Girl products are made with simple, recognizable ingredients — nuts, seeds, coconut, spices, and natural sweeteners like monk fruit. The brand avoids artificial flavours, colours, preservatives, and high-glycemic sweeteners. Products are grain-free, gluten-free, and soy-free, making them suitable for multiple dietary approaches beyond keto, including paleo and diabetic-friendly eating. The company emphasizes that its products are made with "real food" ingredients rather than the heavily processed alternatives that populate some corners of the keto market.

## Canadian and Growing

Farm Girl products are available at health food stores, select grocery retailers, and online across Canada. The brand has built a following among Canadian keto and low-carb communities through social media, recipe sharing, and word of mouth. In the expanding Canadian market for specialty diet foods, Farm Girl has distinguished itself by focusing specifically on breakfast and baking — the meal occasions where people on restrictive diets feel the absence of their old favourites most acutely.
