# MUTANT

MUTANT is a Canadian sports nutrition brand that has carved out a distinct identity in the supplement industry with its unapologetically aggressive branding and products built for serious muscle building. The brand is owned by Fit Foods Ltd., based in Mississauga, Ontario, and has been producing supplements since the early 2000s. Where many supplement brands have moved toward clean, minimalist aesthetics, MUTANT leans into bold, larger-than-life imagery and messaging that resonates with bodybuilders, powerlifters, and hardcore gym enthusiasts.

## Mass Gainers and Beyond

MUTANT made its name with MUTANT MASS, one of the best-selling mass gainer supplements in Canada and internationally. MUTANT MASS delivers a high-calorie blend of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats designed for hardgainers — people who struggle to consume enough calories to build muscle. A single serving can contain over 1,000 calories and 50+ grams of protein. Beyond the flagship mass gainer, the brand produces whey protein (MUTANT WHEY), pre-workout formulas (MADNESS), BCAAs, creatine, and performance supplements spanning the full training cycle.

## Built for the Hardcore

MUTANT's brand identity deliberately sets itself apart from the clean-eating, wellness-focused supplement brands that have proliferated in recent years. The marketing features heavily muscled athletes, bold graphics, and language that speaks directly to the bodybuilding and strength training community. This focus on the hardcore segment has built fierce brand loyalty among its target audience, who see MUTANT as "their" brand in a market increasingly oriented toward casual fitness consumers.

## Canadian Made, Globally Distributed

All MUTANT supplements are formulated and manufactured at Fit Foods' facility in Ontario, ensuring compliance with Health Canada's regulatory standards. The brand exports to over 70 countries, with particularly strong sales in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, where bodybuilding culture is thriving. Despite the global reach, MUTANT remains a Canadian company, and its products are widely available at supplement retailers across the country as well as through major online platforms.
