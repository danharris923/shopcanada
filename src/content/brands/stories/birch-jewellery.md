# Birch Jewellery

About Birch Jewellery meaningfully inspired by natureRooted in the countryside just outside of Ottawa, Ontario, Birch Jewellery is a collection inspired by the quiet beauty of nature and the meaningful connections we carry with us.

Our story began with a simple idea: to create nature-inspired jewellery that captures the beauty found in everyday moments—pieces that feel familiar, intentional, and true. At Birch, we believe in celebrating the beauty of simplicity.

Each piece is thoughtfully crafted with care and intention, inspired by the wonder of nature and the personal stories we hold dear. Whether it is a tribute to a loved one, a memory of home, or a reminder to stay connected to the world around us, Birch Jewellery is made to hold meaning—and to hold space in your story.

Our FounderBehind every Birch piece is Samantha Annett, the designer, founder and heart of the brand. From sketching designs to crafting, packaging, and shipping, Samantha is hands-on with every part of the process.
