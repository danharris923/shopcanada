## What IKEA Means to Canadian Shoppers

IKEA has shaped how Canadians furnish first apartments, outfit family homes, and organize small spaces. The Swedish retailer's flat-pack furniture model makes it possible to leave a store with a bedroom set in a sedan trunk.

## Canadian Jobs & Operations

IKEA Canada employs over 7,900 people across its 16 stores, distribution centres, customer service operations, and national office in Burlington, Ontario. IKEA Canada was recognized as one of Canada's Top Employers.

## Loyalty Program & Savings

The free IKEA Family program offers one point for every $5 spent, free coffee/tea in the Swedish Restaurant, and early access to the As-Is marketplace. The As-Is section sells returned and discontinued items at reduced prices.
