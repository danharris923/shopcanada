# Cureus Label

Curious about us?Cureus Label is a luxury lingerie and intimates brand founded by mother-daughter duo, Nataly and Pilar Cure. The brand name merges the Cure family name, with the spirit of curiosity that inspires every item in our limited-edition collections. Influenced by their experiences as two generations of Latina women who confronted the stigma around embracing their sensuality and bodies, Cureus Label is committed to empowering women with confidence and authenticity, while challenging traditional norms in intimates.Cureus offers modern, non-traditional, and most importantly comfortable intimates that have no underwire ever. Designed in Toronto and ethically handmade in Colombia, all pieces are thoughtfully crafted to feel as good as they look.Signature silhouettes are offered in two high-quality, breathable materials to take you seamlessly from day to night: an ultra-soft cotton line for everyday wear and lounging, and a barely-there nylon mesh that feels like a second skin.Say goodbye to intimidating lingerie, and welcome intimates you’ll want to get curious in.
