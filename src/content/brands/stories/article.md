About Us Article is the easiest way to create a beautiful modern space. Since launching in 2013, we’ve made it our mission to make great style easy, long-lasting and well-priced. We work directly with our manufacturers to produce unique, durable pieces using high-quality materials.

This direct relationship means we can bring you beautiful modern furniture and decor at unrivaled value. To make getting great style easy, we had to figure out how to get it to you... easily. Our team is able to get most in-stock orders from our warehouses to your front door in two weeks or less.

If questions arise, our friendly and knowledgeable Customer Care team is just a phone call, chat or email away. We've delivered quality furniture to more than half a million North American homes and businesses.

Article is staffed by engineers, journalists, painters, weight lifters, slack-liners, mountain bikers, chefs, reiki masters, and more. We want to make the furniture buying process delightfully easy, and to make our every day work more fun and interesting.

Article’s culture is rooted in four core values: Customer Obsession, Do it Differently, Ownership Mindset, Win Together. We’re glad you’re here. Thanks for shopping with us.
