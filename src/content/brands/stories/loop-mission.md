# Loop Mission

Loop Mission is a Montreal-based circular food company founded in 2016 by Julie Poitras-Saulnier and David Côté. The company's mission is to fight food waste by rescuing imperfect, surplus, and unsold fruits and vegetables from farms and distributors, then transforming them into cold-pressed juices, smoothies, soups, alcoholic beverages, and other products. The founding insight was simple: perfectly nutritious produce gets thrown away every day because it doesn't meet the cosmetic standards of grocery stores — bruised apples, oddly shaped carrots, overripe bananas.

## The Circular Model

Loop's business model turns food waste into a commercial product. The company collects fruits and vegetables that would otherwise go to landfill — from farms, distributors, and grocery retailers — and processes them in its Montreal facility. The cold-pressed juices are the flagship product, but Loop has expanded into craft beer (brewed from rescued bread), gin (distilled from surplus potatoes and fruits), frozen smoothie packs, and ready-to-heat soups. Every product carries a label identifying the approximate weight of food rescued in its production.

## The Product Line

Loop's juice line features blends like watermelon-strawberry, green juice (kale, cucumber, apple), and orange-carrot-turmeric. The Loop Gin, made in partnership with a Quebec distillery, uses surplus fruit and grain. Loop Beer is brewed with unsold bread from Montreal bakeries. The products are positioned as premium — this isn't "discount" food, but rather high-quality products made from ingredients that happen to have been rescued from the waste stream. The branding is vibrant and playful, making the food waste message approachable rather than preachy.

## Impact and Availability

Loop Mission has rescued millions of kilograms of food since its founding. The products are available at major Quebec grocery retailers including IGA and Metro, as well as through online delivery platforms. The company has expanded distribution into Ontario and other provinces. Loop has won recognition from sustainability organizations and was selected as one of Canada's most innovative food companies.
