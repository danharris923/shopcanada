## About Princess Polly

THE STORY SO FAR Our obsession with bringing the latest looks to everyday trendsetters goes way back to 2010, when Princess Polly first burst onto the online retail scene from a beachside apartment on Australia’s Gold Coast. Humble beginnings aside, the goal has always been to provide on-trend, quality fashion to our customers with the best customer service they’ve ever had. Behind the brand is a thriving team of 300 (and counting!) super passionate, innovative and creative individuals collaborating across our headquarters in West Hollywood (California, USA) and Burleigh Heads (Queensland, Australia). From designers, content creators, marketers, photographers (and everything in between), our dedicated team is what brings the Princess Polly you know and love to life. Want in on this?
