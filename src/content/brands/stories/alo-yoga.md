# Alo Yoga

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING ALO'S COMMITMENT TO WORKPLACE STANDARDS We build our products on an ethical foundation that honors human rights through every step of the process. As long-time supporters of ethical working conditions, in July 2025, ALO joined the Fair Labor Association (FLA), an international network of companies, universities, and civil society organizations collaborating to ensure that millions of people working at the world’s factories and farms are paid fairly and protected from risks to their health, safety, and well-being.

This decision reflects both our values and our long-term vision. Over the next five years, we will undergo the FLA’s rigorous Accreditation process, which evaluates not just policies but how effectively they are implemented in practice.

This includes: Strengthening our social compliance program to align with globally respected standards; Ensuring independent monitoring of our supply chain to identify and address risks; Building management systems for remediation, worker empowerment, and training; Demonstrating transparency through public reporting and FLA verification To reinforce this commitment, we are investing in a dedicated Social Compliance team to lead and implement these programs.
