# Joe Fresh

Joe Fresh launched in 2006 as the brainchild of Joe Mimran, the same designer who co-founded Club Monaco in the 1980s. The concept was ambitious: bring stylish, well-designed clothing to Canadians at grocery store prices, sold inside Loblaw supermarkets. It sounded improbable, but it worked. Within a few years, Joe Fresh became one of Canada's best-selling clothing brands, and colourful Joe Fresh racks became a fixture in Loblaw, Real Canadian Superstore, and Shoppers Drug Mart locations nationwide.

## Design at Supermarket Prices

Mimran's background in fashion gave Joe Fresh a design sensibility that set it apart from other budget brands. The early collections drew attention for their bold colours, clean lines, and modern basics that looked far more expensive than their price tags suggested. A Joe Fresh T-shirt for $8 or a dress for $29 offered genuine style without the markup. Mimran led the brand's creative direction until 2014, establishing the aesthetic DNA that continues to guide the label.

## Available Everywhere

Joe Fresh is available at over 1,400 locations across Canada through the Loblaw network, making it one of the most accessible fashion brands in the country. Dedicated Joe Fresh stores and shop-in-shops in major malls provide a more curated retail experience. The brand also operates joefresh.com for online shopping with Canadian shipping. The product range covers women's, men's, kids', and baby clothing, plus accessories, shoes, and beauty products.

## A Canadian Fashion Staple

What makes Joe Fresh unusual in the fashion world is its distribution model. No other major clothing brand sells primarily through grocery stores. This model keeps overhead low and puts the product in front of millions of shoppers who are already in the store for milk and bread. The result is a brand that reaches demographics that fashion retailers typically miss, from suburban families to rural communities where specialty clothing stores are scarce.
