# Nala Care

Our vision is to bring preventative care into our daily lives. Our mission is to create body care products that inspire self knowing, self care, and self advocacy. The Origins of Nala In 2013, we lost a vital member of our family to cancer.

Alan – father, husband, friend, and mentor – whose energy was contagious and had a tendency towards larger than life ideas – was claimed by stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. It felt too cruel and it definitely felt too soon to lose someone deserving of so much more life.

Deep loss inspired deeper inquiry, and as we waded through the realities of health and wellbeing, Nala grew from an idea into a necessity. We became incapable of ignoring an issue that rattled us deep within – a value we carry forth into what Nala stands for today.

We are a mother-daughter founding duo, Radmila (Mila) and Ada. Leveraging our backgrounds in biotech engineering and technology, our goals are twofold:Change the way we, as a society, view health & self care by providing high quality products free-from negative side effects.

End the meaningless suffering that comes from losing loved ones too soon. "At Nala, we want you to care for yourself in a way that keeps you around for those closest to you for a long, long time to come" - Ada Juristovski Jemc We Stand For Nala is a natural and organic body care brand that formulates high quality, efficacious products, while encouraging deep self care.

When you choose a Nala product, you can be certain you’re choosing a solution that will not damage your health. Beyond the literal, our free-from label is aspirational. It puts high-quality ingredients at the forefront, and reminds us that our deepest commitment is to create something free from the negativity and pitfalls of the current beauty industry.
