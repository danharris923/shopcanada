# Van Houtte

Albert-Louis Van Houtte opened a small coffee shop in Montreal in 1919, importing and roasting European-style coffee at a time when most Canadians drank whatever came in the tin. Over the following century, the Van Houtte name became synonymous with quality coffee in Quebec and across Canada. The company grew from a single shop into a major coffee roaster, cafe operator, and office coffee service provider. Today, Van Houtte Coffee Services is Canada's leading workplace coffee solutions provider, serving businesses from coast to coast.

## A Century of Coffee Heritage

Van Houtte's history spans the evolution of Canadian coffee culture. The company was a pioneer in bringing specialty roasting to the Canadian market, introducing Canadians to single-origin coffees and European roasting styles decades before the third-wave coffee movement. Through the 20th century, Van Houtte operated a chain of cafes in Quebec that predated Starbucks' arrival in Canada. The roasting expertise built over a century remains central to the brand's identity, even as the business model has shifted.

## Office Coffee Services

Van Houtte Coffee Services has become the dominant player in Canada's office and workplace coffee market. The company provides businesses with coffee machines, a curated selection of coffees (from Van Houtte's own roasts to other premium brands), teas, hot chocolate, and related supplies. The service model includes machine installation, maintenance, and regular product delivery — a turnkey solution that ensures employees have quality coffee without the business needing to manage it. The service covers offices, healthcare facilities, hotels, restaurants, and institutions across Canada.

## Part of Keurig Dr Pepper

Van Houtte is now part of the Keurig Dr Pepper family, which acquired the brand and its K-Cup compatible single-serve coffee system. Van Houtte coffees are among the most popular K-Cup varieties in Canada, available in grocery stores nationwide. Despite the corporate ownership, the brand maintains its Quebec roots and its association with over a century of Canadian coffee heritage — a legacy that few competitors can match.
