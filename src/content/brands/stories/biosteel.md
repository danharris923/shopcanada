# BioSteel

BioSteel was founded in 2009 by John Celenza and Michael Cammalleri (then an NHL player with the Montreal Canadiens) in Toronto, Ontario. The brand was born from a desire to create a sports drink that professional athletes could trust — one made without sugar, artificial colours, flavours, or sweeteners. The original product, BioSteel High Performance Sports Mix, was a powder-based hydration formula that spread through NHL locker rooms via word of mouth before it ever hit retail shelves.

## The Locker Room to Retail Pipeline

BioSteel's early growth was driven almost entirely by professional athlete endorsement. The distinctive pink drink became a familiar sight on NHL benches, NBA sidelines, and in MLB dugouts. Players including Connor McDavid, Patrick Mahomes, and Luka Doncic became investors and ambassadors. This top-down adoption strategy — starting with elite athletes and filtering down to recreational consumers — gave BioSteel a credibility that conventional marketing could not buy. By the time the brand launched ready-to-drink cans, the "best-kept secret in sports" tagline had become a known quantity.

## The Product Line

BioSteel's product range expanded from the original hydration mix to include ready-to-drink cans, protein powders, pre-workout formulas, and recovery supplements. The hydration products use a blend of B vitamins, amino acids, and electrolytes without sugar or artificial ingredients. The ready-to-drink cans, available in flavours like Rainbow Twist, Peach Mango, and Mixed Berry, are sugar-free and contain only 10 calories, positioning them as a cleaner alternative to Gatorade and Powerade.

## Canopy Acquisition and Beyond

In 2022, Canopy Growth Corporation acquired BioSteel, aiming to leverage the brand's sports marketing connections. The acquisition brought investment but also corporate challenges as Canopy restructured. Despite the ownership changes, BioSteel products remain available at major Canadian retailers including Shoppers Drug Mart, Loblaws, and convenience stores, as well as through Amazon and the brand's own website. The brand continues to be associated with clean sport hydration and its roots in Canadian professional sports culture.
