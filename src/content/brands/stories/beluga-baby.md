# Beluga Baby

Beluga Baby is a Canadian baby carrier and wrap brand ethically handmade in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company produces baby wraps for newborns and the Cove structured carrier for older babies, both designed to make babywearing accessible, comfortable, and beautiful. Beluga Baby is part of the growing movement encouraging parents to keep their babies close through carriers that distribute weight comfortably and support healthy infant development.

## Wraps and Carriers

Beluga Baby's product line centres on two core products: the Beluga Wrap for newborns up to 25 pounds, and the Cove Baby Carrier for babies from 7 to 50 pounds. The wraps are made from soft, stretchy fabric that molds to both parent and baby, creating a secure, womb-like hold that soothes infants and frees parents' hands. The Cove carrier is a structured design for older, heavier babies who need more support, offering an ergonomic seat and adjustable fit. The brand also makes accessories including drool pads, swaddles, and baby books.

## Ethically Made in Vancouver

Every Beluga Baby product is ethically handmade in Vancouver by a local team. The brand maintains full visibility over its manufacturing process, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and quality control at every stage. Fabrics are chosen for softness, breathability, and safety against infant skin, and the brand avoids synthetic materials and harsh dyes. The local production model means shorter supply chains, lower environmental impact, and the ability to produce in smaller, more responsive batches.

## For Canadian Families

Beluga Baby sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The brand has built a community of babywearing parents who appreciate the quality, comfort, and ethics behind each product. For Canadian parents looking for a baby carrier that's locally made, safe, and designed to support both infant comfort and parent convenience, Beluga Baby offers a thoughtful alternative to mass-produced baby gear.
