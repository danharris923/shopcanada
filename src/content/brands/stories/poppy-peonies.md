# Poppy Peonies

Our BrandAt Poppy & Peonies, we believe you shouldn't have to compromise style for function. Whether your day consists of board meetings or diaper duty, our products meet you where you are. We’re passionate about designing practical pieces that help lighten life’s load – often literally – so you can navigate your busy days with ease.

Founded by Natalie Dusome, a mom determined to navigate modern motherhood in style. Poppy & Peonies is a Métis female-founded, cruelty-free, Canadian accessory brand. Meet Our FounderHi I’m Nat, the founder and designer of Poppy & Peonies.

Growing up in small-town Ontario, I was a little girl with a big dream: to become a fashion designer. I would drive my parents crazy-making clothes out of vintage curtains and harassing the local shop owners to carry my wire handbags as a teenager.

This passion led me to design school, and after graduating, I honed my skills designing for global brands across Canada and the U. S. Then, something magical happened. My sweet daughter, Poppy, was born, and everything changed.

My pre-baby accessories no longer fit my new life as a mom – I needed lots of pockets and organization. When my search for functional fashion came up empty-handed, I had a feeling I wasn’t alone. So, armed with an idea, lots of determination, and a six-month-old baby on my hip, Poppy & Peonies was born.

We’ve come a long way in five years – from filling orders in my basement to appearing on Dragon’s Den, and now, expanding into new product categories and collaborating with some exciting brands. I’d be lying if I said it’s been nothing but smooth sailing, but thanks to our incredible community who inspires me every day, we have never felt more loved and supported!
