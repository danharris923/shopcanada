# Huha

Where it began With recurring UTIs Our founder knew underwear needed to be more breathable when she went through a string of UTIs. She started designing underwear that would suit our most sensitive areas, and Huha's Mineral Undies™ were born. solving for breathability A breath of fresh wear What the polyester and nylon-filled bargain bins of the world don't tell us is that they actually don't breathe. These fabrics create a barrier around our sensitive areas leading to a buildup of moisture, warmth, and ultimately, bacteria. Our mission Embrace your body, as it is We design thoughtful skin-layer garments for bodies that breathe, sweat, move, and live. We obsess over fit, comfort, and functional fabrics—because we think your underwear should work with your body, not against it.
