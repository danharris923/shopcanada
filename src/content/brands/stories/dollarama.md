# Dollarama

Proudly Serving Customers From Coast to Coast Dollarama was founded by third-generation retailer and Canadian entrepreneur, Larry Rossy. It all started with one store, in Matane, Quebec, in 1992, and quickly grew over the next two decades to become a household name and shopping destination for Canadians from coast to coast.

Dollarama today is a recognized Canadian value retailer with international reach, with more than 2,700 locations and 41,000 people serving customers on three continents and in seven countries. The Corporation is led by Neil Rossy, fourth-generation retailer and member of Dollarama’s founding management team.

Dollarama aims to provide customers with a consistent shopping experience and compelling value, offering a broad assortment of general merchandise, consumables and seasonal items.
