# Mary Young

Mary Young is a Canadian intimates and loungewear brand founded in September 2014 by designer Mary Young in Toronto. Young launched the brand after completing a double thesis at Toronto Metropolitan University, where she produced a five-piece lingerie and knitwear collection for the year-end Mass Exodus fashion show. The collection's reception from the industry gave her the confidence to turn the project into a business. She had identified a gap for lifestyle lingerie focused on comfort and ease rather than show pieces that restructure the natural body — the antithesis of Victoria's Secret.

## Made in Canada

Every Mary Young garment is produced in Montreal at a small production house where workers are paid a living wage. The brand has been 100% Canadian-made since day one, a deliberate commitment to investing in the Canadian economy. The primary fabric is OEKO-TEX certified rayon of bamboo, chosen for its softness and tested to be free of harmful substances. The line includes bras, underwear, bodysuits, loungewear, and swimwear in sizes XS to 2X, using soft knits and natural materials in place of thick padding and stiff underwire. Low-waste cutting techniques reduce fabric waste, and limited collections use deadstock and end-of-roll fabric.

## Self Love Club

Mary Young built a community around the brand through the Self Love Club — a program of blog stories, in-person events, and a podcast creating spaces for conversations about self-care and body acceptance. Three dollars from every item sold is donated to Raw Beauty Talks. The brand has been featured on Good On You with a "Good" labour rating, reflecting its fair wage practices and regular supplier audits.

## A Canadian Intimates Brand

Mary Young sells through her online store and stockists across Canada, the United States, and Japan. The brand is currently transitioning into its next era, with Young inviting her community to stay connected as she explores what comes next for the label she built from a university thesis project.
