# Frank And Oak

Ethan Song and Hicham Ratnani founded Frank And Oak in 2012 in Montreal's Mile End neighbourhood, starting as an online-only menswear brand that used data to predict what styles customers wanted before they even knew they wanted them. The concept was a subscription-style box service that shipped curated outfits to members, an approach that was ahead of its time in Canadian fashion. Within two years, the brand had expanded into physical retail and broadened into women's clothing.

## The Sustainability Pivot

Around 2018, Frank And Oak made a deliberate shift toward sustainable fashion that has come to define the brand. The company committed to using recycled, organic, and responsibly sourced materials across its entire collection. By 2023, 100% of the brand's assortment met its internal standard for responsible materials, which includes low-impact fibres, cruelty-free sourcing, and recycled content. The denim line is designed to be fully circular, using zero rivets and conscious materials to make recycling possible. Less than 0.5% of products contain virgin polyester.

## Montreal Roots

Frank And Oak's headquarters remain in Montreal, where the company designs and develops its collections. The brand operates retail stores in major Canadian cities and ships across North America through its online store. The product range covers men's and women's clothing, outerwear, footwear, and accessories, all with the same emphasis on durability and responsible production. Pricing sits in the mid-range, with most items between $50 and $200 CAD, positioning the brand as an accessible entry point into sustainable fashion.

## Navigating Challenges

Frank And Oak has not had a smooth trajectory. The company went through a restructuring process and ownership changes as it navigated the challenges facing Canadian retail and the high costs of sustainable production. Despite these difficulties, the brand has maintained its identity and its Montreal base, continuing to attract customers who want fashion that aligns with their environmental values without requiring a luxury-tier budget.
