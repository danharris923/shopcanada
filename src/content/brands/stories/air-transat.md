# Air Transat

Air Transat took its first flight on November 14, 1987, operating a Boeing 737 from Montreal to Acapulco. The airline was founded as the air travel arm of Transat A.T. Inc., a Montreal-based integrated tourism company that also operates tour packages, hotel properties, and travel distribution. From the beginning, Air Transat was built to serve the Canadian leisure travel market — sun destinations in winter, European cities in summer — rather than competing head-to-head with Air Canada and WestJet on domestic routes.

## Canada's Leisure Airline

Air Transat carved out a distinct position as Canada's leading leisure carrier, specializing in transatlantic flights to Europe and seasonal service to Caribbean and Central American sun destinations. The airline operates from bases in Montreal, Toronto, Quebec City, and Vancouver, with seasonal departures from other Canadian cities. European destinations include Paris, London, Rome, Lisbon, Barcelona, Athens, and dozens of others, making Air Transat one of the largest providers of Canada-to-Europe flights. The airline has won Skytrax's World's Best Leisure Airline award multiple times.

## The Fleet and Experience

Air Transat operates a fleet of Airbus A321neo LR and A330 wide-body aircraft. The A321neo LR jets, introduced to modernize the fleet, offer improved fuel efficiency and a refreshed cabin product. The airline offers Economy, Economy Comfort (extra legroom), and Club Class (premium) cabins. While it's not a full-service legacy carrier, Air Transat includes meals and baggage in its fares and provides an experience that sits above ultra-low-cost carriers — a positioning that appeals to vacation travellers who want value without the nickel-and-diming.

## Part of Transat A.T.

Air Transat's parent company, Transat A.T. Inc. (TSX: TRZ), is headquartered in Montreal and is one of the world's largest integrated tourism companies. The company survived a failed acquisition attempt by Air Canada in 2021, which was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds. Transat emerged as an independent company and refocused on its core strengths: affordable transatlantic travel and vacation packages. The airline employs thousands of Canadians and remains a significant player in the country's tourism industry.
