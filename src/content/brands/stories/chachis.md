# Chachi's

Chachi's is a family-owned restaurant chain based in British Columbia that has built a loyal following around generous portions of Italian-American comfort food at honest prices. The brand operates casual dining restaurants primarily in the Vancouver area and Fraser Valley, with a menu that reads like a greatest hits of crowd-pleasing fare: pasta, pizza, steaks, ribs, burgers, and seafood. The restaurants are designed as neighbourhood gathering spots where families, couples, and groups of friends can settle in for a satisfying meal without breaking the bank.

## The Menu

Chachi's menu is unapologetically large and indulgent. Pasta dishes range from classic spaghetti and meatballs to fettuccine alfredo and baked lasagna, all served in portions that regularly prompt takeout containers. The pizza menu features hand-tossed dough with a variety of toppings. Beyond the Italian staples, the menu extends to ribs, steaks, fish and chips, souvlaki, and a selection of appetizers including wings, calamari, and garlic bread. The breadth of the menu is deliberate — Chachi's positions itself as the restaurant where everyone in the group can find something they want.

## British Columbia Roots

Chachi's locations are concentrated in British Columbia's Lower Mainland, including spots in Langley, Abbotsford, and surrounding communities. The restaurants occupy a sweet spot in the local dining landscape: more substantial than fast-casual chains but more affordable and relaxed than upscale Italian restaurants. The family-ownership model means decisions are made locally rather than by a distant corporate office, which shows up in the consistency and personal touch that regulars appreciate.

## Community Focus

Chachi's has maintained a community-oriented approach, sponsoring local sports teams, participating in charity events, and maintaining relationships with regular customers that span years. The restaurants are the kind of places where staff know returning families by name and remember their usual orders. In a restaurant industry increasingly dominated by national chains and franchise operations, Chachi's represents the locally owned, family-run model that many Canadians seek out and support.
