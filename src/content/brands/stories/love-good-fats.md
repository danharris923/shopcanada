# Love Good Fats

A New Way of Eating Our story begins in 2017 with Suzie Yorke, a trailblazer on a mission to redefine healthy snacking with high-protein, low sugar bars that taste amazing. Flash-forward to 2024, meet Patrick, Tammy and Jon, three food entrepreneurs who picked up the torch of Suzie’s legacy, on a mission to satisfy your cravings for both indulgence and nutrition.

Our why remains a dedication to empowering you to make healthier choices, without compromising on enjoyment. At Love Good, we believe moments of feeling good matter and we’re here to celebrate that feeling with everyone, one bite at a time.
