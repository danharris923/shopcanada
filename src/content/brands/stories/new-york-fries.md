# New York Fries

Jay Gupta opened the first New York Fries in 1984 at the Scarborough Town Centre food court in Toronto, despite never having been to New York City. The name was purely aspirational. The product, however, was specific and deliberate: fresh-cut fries made from whole potatoes, hand-cut and cooked in non-hydrogenated oil right in front of the customer. That commitment to visible, simple preparation struck a nerve in a fast-food landscape dominated by frozen products.

## The Mall Food Court King

New York Fries became synonymous with the Canadian mall experience. The brand grew rapidly through the late 1980s and 1990s, with open-concept kiosks positioned in high-traffic food courts where the smell of freshly cooked fries served as its primary advertising. The menu stayed intentionally narrow: fries, poutine, and hot dogs. This focus allowed the brand to execute a few things exceptionally well rather than diluting its identity across a broad menu. The poutine, topped with real cheese curds and gravy, became a particular favourite.

## Canadian-Owned, Globally Present

New York Fries is owned by Jay Gupta's company and remains Canadian-owned and operated. The chain has expanded to over 120 locations across Canada, primarily in shopping centres but also in airports and standalone locations. International franchises operate in South Korea, the UAE, Hong Kong, and other markets. Despite the New York branding, the company is proudly headquartered in Toronto and uses only Canadian-grown potatoes, primarily sourced from farms in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

## Simple Done Right

In an era when restaurant chains chase trends and expand menus endlessly, New York Fries has stuck to its original formula. The fries are still hand-cut from whole potatoes daily, the oil is still non-hydrogenated sunflower, and the preparation still happens in full view of the customer. Seasonal flavour offerings like buffalo, garlic, and truffle fries add variety without compromising the core product.
