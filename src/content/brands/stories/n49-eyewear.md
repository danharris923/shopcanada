If you support the Made-in-Canada movement, we invite you to look into our brand N49° Eyewear. The name N49° Eyewear comes from the 49th parallel Not only is N49° Eyewear Canadian brand and produced in Canada, it also has each model named after Canadian towns, places or cities, reflecting the diversity of the inhabitants and range from sophisticated urban locales to more laid-back municipalities.

As each city has its own unique personality, N49° Eyewear offers something for every type of wear to explore. We've carefully selected the names for our models of towns, places or cities because each one features something spectacular that you can't find anywhere else in the country — or possibly even the world.

What an engineer produces will not necessarily look good to the designer. What the designer and the engineer produce, may not be what an optician actually needs! Years of research and development have been invested into a cutting-edge production line running on an amazing level of 5-axis technology.
