# Nellie's

Nellie's Clean is a Canadian eco-friendly cleaning product brand founded by James Roberts in honour of his mother, Nellie, whose approach to household cleaning relied on simple, effective ingredients rather than harsh chemicals. The company produces laundry soda, dryer balls, dish soap, and household cleaners that are non-toxic, hypoallergenic, and safe for families with babies, children, and pets. The brand launched in Vancouver and has grown from a local favourite into an internationally distributed cleaning brand.

## The Products

Nellie's flagship product is the Laundry Soda — a concentrated, plant-based powder that cleans effectively without phosphates, synthetic fragrances, or optical brighteners. A single tin lasts for 100 loads, dramatically reducing packaging waste compared to liquid detergent jugs. Nellie's Wool Dryer Balls — reusable felted balls that replace single-use dryer sheets — became another breakthrough product, reducing drying time while softening clothes naturally. The product line has expanded to include dish powder, all-purpose cleaner, floor care, and oxygen brightener, all following the same philosophy of simple, effective, non-toxic ingredients.

## Eco-Friendly by Design

Nellie's was designed with environmental impact in mind before "green cleaning" was a mainstream category. The concentrated formulas reduce shipping weight and packaging. The tin containers are reusable and recyclable. The dryer balls replace thousands of disposable dryer sheets over their lifetime. The products are biodegradable, septic-safe, and free from chlorine, SLS, and artificial fragrances. The brand earned certifications from Leaping Bunny (cruelty-free) and is recognized by environmental organizations for its commitment to sustainable cleaning.

## From Vancouver to the World

Nellie's products are available at major Canadian retailers including Canadian Tire, London Drugs, and Whole Foods, as well as through Amazon and the brand's online store. The company has expanded internationally, with distribution in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Despite the growth, the brand maintains its connection to Nellie's legacy — the idea that clean homes don't require dirty chemicals.
