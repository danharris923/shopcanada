The Fatburger Story A Humble Beginning Fatburger Founder Lovie Yancey From Dennis McLellan’s 2008 Los Angeles Times article “ Fatburger founder expanded South L. A. eatery into chain “ In 1947, using pieces of scrap materials from her partner (a man who worked at a construction company), Lovie Yancey opened up a three-stool hamburger stand in Los Angeles, California (on Western Avenue) – it was called Mr.

Fatburger. “The name of the store was my idea, I wanted to get across the idea of a big burger with everything on it . . . a meal in itself. ” — Fatburger Founder, Lovie Yancey By 1952, Lovie parted ways with her partner and so did the “Mr.

” from the stand’s name. The Original Fatburger Stand in Los Angeles, California From the beginning, Lovie was a fixture at the stand where customers, including entertainers Redd Foxx and Ray Charles, would custom-order their burgers.

She would work very long days, and sleepless nights, spending as much time at the stand as she could to ensure that everything was being done properly. As word got out that Lovie’s Fatburgers were the best in town, she continually got more and more requests for her to keep the stand open later, and later, into the night.

Over 65 years later, while other places are just discovering taste, we’re still making hamburgers the way she did. Cooked-to-order, just the way you want it, every time. The only thing Lovie loved as much as hamburgers was music.

So you’ll hear some of the best music ever blasting: Current Hits, Rock’n’Roll, R&B, Hip-Hop, and Classic Soul that’ll keep you groovin’ in your chair long enough to finish that big juicy burger. We’d love to tell you about the late night talk show hosts and rap stars who’ve made us the happenin’ place—but our attorneys won’t let us.

(And, of course, restaurant critics keep naming us the best burger in town, but you don’t care about those guys. ) Fatburger in Canada In 2005, the first Fatburger Canada opened in the popular English Bay area of Vancouver, BC.
