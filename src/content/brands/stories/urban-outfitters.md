# Urban Outfitters

Urban Outfitters is an American lifestyle retailer founded in 1970 by Dick Hayne and Scott Belair near the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Originally called "Free People" (now a separate brand), the store was renamed Urban Outfitters and grew into a global chain known for its eclectic mix of fashion, apartment decor, vinyl records, books, and novelty gifts — all curated for a creative, trend-aware young adult demographic. The brand straddles the line between fashion retailer and cultural curator.

## Fashion and Lifestyle

Urban Outfitters' clothing selection mixes its own label with a curated roster of external brands, creating an aesthetic that pulls from vintage, streetwear, bohemian, and indie influences. The fashion leans toward the experimental and trend-forward, with a particular strength in denim, graphic tees, and vintage-inspired pieces. Beyond clothing, the stores carry apartment furnishings, tech accessories, candles, stationery, party supplies, and an extensive vinyl record selection — creating a one-stop shop for the aesthetics of young adult life.

## The Store Experience

Urban Outfitters stores are designed to feel like exploration rather than shopping. Each location has a distinct layout and decor, with curated music, art installations, and merchandising that encourages browsing and discovery. The brand's physical retail has survived the e-commerce era partly because the stores offer something Amazon can't — an atmosphere that makes shopping a cultural experience rather than a transaction.

## Urban Outfitters in Canada

Urban Outfitters operates a full Canadian site at urbanoutfitters.com/en-ca with CAD pricing, and maintains retail locations in major Canadian cities. The brand ships across Canada and offers the same lifestyle curation online that defines its physical stores. For young Canadians who want their fashion, home decor, and music purchases to feel like an extension of their identity rather than a chore, Urban Outfitters provides a shopping experience built around creativity and self-expression.
