F. A. Q. Important Shipping Update We are temporarily shipping your order via Purolator to maintain smooth and timely deliveries during the Canada Post labor disruption. For more on the labour disruption click here.

Why have you changed shipping from Canada Post to Purolator? We have temporarily transitioned to Purolator for order shipments to maintain smooth and timely deliveries in anticipation of a potential labor disruption at Canada Post.

Will you switch back to Canada Post? Yes, we plan to switch back once we are confident there will be no further disruptions to Canada Post services or once the labor disruption has ended. We will keep you updated with any changes.

How does the switch to Purolator affect my order? With the switch to Purolator, your order will still arrive within the usual 3-7 business day delivery window. PO Box addresses: Purolator cannot deliver to PO Boxes or community mailboxes.

Please provide a physical street address for your order. Remote/Rural Areas: Purolator may not deliver to select remote and rural areas. Need help confirming delivery to your area? Visit the Purolator.
