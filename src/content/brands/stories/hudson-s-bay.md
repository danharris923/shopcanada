# Hudson's Bay

The Hudson's Bay Company was chartered on May 2, 1670, by King Charles II of England, making it the oldest incorporated joint-stock merchandising company in the English-speaking world. Originally established to trade furs in the vast territory surrounding Hudson Bay, the company's history spans more than 350 years and is inseparable from the history of Canada itself. The HBC controlled an enormous swath of North American territory — Rupert's Land — that would eventually become much of Western and Northern Canada.

## From Fur Trade to Department Store

The transition from fur trading company to department store happened gradually over the 19th and 20th centuries. The HBC opened retail shops at its fur trading posts, which evolved into full-service department stores as Canadian towns grew around them. By the mid-20th century, The Bay (as it was commonly known) had become one of Canada's premier department store chains, competing with Eaton's and Simpson's. The stores were known for their wide selection of fashion, home goods, cosmetics, and the iconic Hudson's Bay point blankets, which have been in production since 1780.

## The Iconic Stripes

The Hudson's Bay point blanket, with its green, red, yellow, and indigo stripes on a white background, is one of the most recognized designs in Canadian history. Originally used in the fur trade, where the "points" on the blanket indicated its size and trade value in beaver pelts, the blanket has become a symbol of Canadian heritage. The stripe pattern now appears on everything from coats and scarves to mittens and bags, forming a lucrative heritage brand within the larger retail operation.

## Modern Challenges

In recent years, Hudson's Bay has faced significant challenges. The company went through ownership changes, including a period under NRDC Equity Partners, and has been navigating the same headwinds that have battered department stores globally: competition from e-commerce, fast fashion, and specialty retailers. The company closed underperforming locations and reinvested in its digital presence through thebay.com. Despite the turbulence, Hudson's Bay remains a culturally significant Canadian institution, and its flagship stores on Queen Street in Toronto and Sainte-Catherine Street in Montreal are architectural landmarks.
