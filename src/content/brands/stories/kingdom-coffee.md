# Kingdom Coffee

0CARTOUR STORYFrom heroin, crack cocaine and homelessness to REDEMPTION!Jim was homeless, hooked on drugs and suicidal. Four strangers shared a conversation which led to Jim checking into a recovery center. Jim was able to find sobriety after a 30 your addiction, find his identity and went from being an angry violent man to a man his family adored. Jim was helping others get off the streets and into recovery, when he tragically passed away in a workplace accident. We have since become those strangers, we offer up hope with a cup of coffee and conversation to the homeless every week. A portion of every bag sold goes to helping people off the street, into recovery and finding them a place to stay. Jim was my Dad and this is his story. ​ ​ Jesse & Steph Singleton ​ ​Click here to see a CTV News Story on Kingdom Coffee
