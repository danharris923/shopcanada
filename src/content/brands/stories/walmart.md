# Walmart Canada

## Walmart's Canadian Journey

Walmart entered Canada in 1994 by acquiring the Woolco chain. Today, Walmart Canada employs over 100,000 associates and serves millions of customers weekly through its Supercentres, discount stores, and online platform.

## Save Money. Live Better.

Walmart Canada focuses on providing Canadians with low prices on essentials. The Rollback program offers temporary price reductions, while the Great Value brand provides affordable alternatives to national brands.
