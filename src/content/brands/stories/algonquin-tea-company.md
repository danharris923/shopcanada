# Algonquin Tea Company

Algonquin Tea Company is an Indigenous-owned Canadian tea brand that harvests wild plants and herbs from the forests and fields of Algonquin territory in Ontario. The company approaches wildcrafting — the practice of harvesting plants from their natural habitat — with deep respect for the land and traditional ecological knowledge passed down through generations. Plants are gathered sustainably, "grazing like deer" to take only what is needed and leave the ecosystem thriving for future harvests.

## Wild-Harvested Teas

Algonquin Tea Company produces loose leaf teas and herbal blends made from wild-harvested ingredients including Labrador tea, chaga mushroom, white pine needles, wild mint, and other plants native to the Canadian Shield. These aren't imported tea leaves flavoured with local ingredients — they are genuinely wild Canadian plants dried and blended into teas that taste of the northern forests where they grew. Each blend connects the drinker to the land and to centuries of Indigenous plant knowledge.

## Rooted in Tradition

The company's harvesting practices are guided by traditional Indigenous relationships with the land. Songs of thanks, sustainable gathering methods, and a deep understanding of plant cycles inform every harvest. This isn't performative — it's the continuation of practices that have sustained these lands and peoples for thousands of years. The company views its work as reconnecting people with the earth and with the traditional knowledge that modern life has disconnected many from.

## From the Forest to Your Cup

Algonquin Tea Company sells through its online store and at select retailers and markets across Canada. The brand offers Canadians something no conventional tea company can: a genuine, direct connection to the wild landscape and Indigenous traditions of this land. For tea drinkers who want their cup to carry meaning, place, and respect for the natural world, Algonquin Tea Company delivers an experience rooted in thousands of years of knowledge.
