Our Founding Story After struggling with severe allergies and eczema all her life, Julie Clark was tired of trying to cover up her eczema with steroid creams. She knew there had to be a better way. Armed with a spatula and a mixing bowl, she began formulating her own natural, organic skincare products.

Despite her busy schedule as a costume designer and stylist, Julie found herself drawn to holistic healing and plant medicine, using her time off to experiment with oils, waxes and herbs—all in pursuit of healing her eczema.

Long story, short: It worked. In helping people achieve radiant and healthy skin, Julie had found her passion and calling. In 2010, Julie began studying Aromatherapy, Holistic Health, Herbal Medicine and Esthetics in Toronto.

Here, she formed the foundation of her skincare expertise, and the Province Apothecary skincare line and spa was born. "I gather inspiration for our products from our team, customers, and the seasons” says Julie, "Our formulas are founded on plant medicine & holistic wellness and are backed by science.
