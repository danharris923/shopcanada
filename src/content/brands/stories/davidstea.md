We like to call it tea that goes beyond tea—has a nice ring to it, right? tea is just as essential as water Kidding! Maybe... Do not ditch water—seriously, that’s still a non-negotiable. But when you take a moment to think about it, tea is super hydrating.

It might even be second to water... From now on, you can think of tea, AKA Camellia sinensis, as your daily hydration hero that’s good for you and makes you feel good, too! we have it all, so you can have it all Your (tea) dreams have come true.
