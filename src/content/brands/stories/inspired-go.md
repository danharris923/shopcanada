# Inspired Go

Inspired Go is a Calgary-based prepared meal company that launched with a simple premise: make fresh, healthy eating as convenient as grabbing fast food. The company produces ready-to-eat salads, grain bowls, breakfast items, and snacks that are delivered fresh — never frozen — to customers' homes, offices, and retail locations across Western Canada. The brand was built for busy professionals, families, and anyone who wants to eat well but doesn't have the time or energy to meal prep every week.

## The Menu

Inspired Go's menu rotates seasonally and features chef-developed recipes that prioritize whole ingredients, balanced nutrition, and actual flavour. The salad line includes options like Thai Crunch, Baja, and Mediterranean varieties, each arriving in a sealed container with dressing on the side. Grain bowls feature bases like quinoa or rice topped with proteins and roasted vegetables. Breakfast options include overnight oats, chia puddings, and egg cups. The brand also offers smoothies, energy balls, and snack packs. All items are calorie-counted and include full nutritional information.

## Fresh, Not Frozen

What distinguishes Inspired Go from frozen meal delivery services is the commitment to freshness. Meals are prepared in the company's Calgary kitchen and delivered within days of production, without freezing or using the preservatives that extend shelf life in conventional prepared foods. This fresh-first approach limits the delivery radius but results in a product that tastes noticeably better than frozen alternatives. The company has also partnered with grocery retailers and convenience stores to stock Inspired Go products in grab-and-go refrigerators.

## Growing Across the West

Inspired Go delivers directly to homes and offices in Calgary, Edmonton, and surrounding areas, with retail distribution expanding across Alberta and into British Columbia. The company has built a subscription model that encourages regular ordering, with weekly menus that keep the selection fresh. In the growing Canadian prepared meal market, Inspired Go has differentiated itself by staying regional, staying fresh, and maintaining the quality that comes from producing everything in-house rather than outsourcing to a co-packer.
