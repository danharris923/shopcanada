# BN3TH

BN3TH (pronounced "beneath") is a Canadian men's underwear brand founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, that built its reputation on a patented pouch design called MyPakage. The brand was created to solve the most common complaint about men's underwear: the uncomfortable bunching, chafing, and readjusting that comes with conventional designs. BN3TH's 3D pouch technology provides anatomical support and separation, keeping everything in place without the need for constant adjustment throughout the day.

## The MyPakage Pouch

The core innovation behind BN3TH is the patented MyPakage pouch, a three-dimensional internal structure that cradles and supports without compression. Unlike traditional boxer briefs that rely on flat fabric panels, the pouch creates a separate space that prevents skin-on-skin contact and eliminates the friction that causes chafing. The technology was developed through years of prototyping and testing, and it's the feature that converts first-time buyers into loyal customers — once you wear a pair, conventional underwear feels like a step backward.

## Performance Fabrics

BN3TH pairs its pouch technology with premium performance fabrics including modal, tencel, and proprietary blends that wick moisture, regulate temperature, and resist odour. The product line spans everyday boxer briefs, trunks, and briefs, as well as sport-specific designs for running, cycling, and training. The brand also produces base layers and lounge wear built on the same comfort principles. Every product is designed to move with the body during activity while maintaining its shape and support through hundreds of washes.

## Vancouver Born, Globally Worn

BN3TH is headquartered in Vancouver and sells through its online store, major retailers including Nordstrom, REI, and sporting goods chains, and independent shops across Canada and internationally. The brand has won multiple industry awards for product innovation and has built a devoted following among men who take underwear comfort seriously. For Canadian men who have settled for underwear that's merely "fine," BN3TH demonstrates what happens when real engineering meets an everyday essential.
