# Aerie

Aerie is the intimates, loungewear, and activewear brand from American Eagle Outfitters, launched in 2006 and now operating as one of the company's most successful divisions. The brand is best known for its body-positive marketing — Aerie made waves in 2014 when it became one of the first major brands to stop retouching models in its advertising, showing real bodies without airbrushing. The #AerieREAL campaign helped redefine how intimate apparel is marketed and earned the brand a fiercely loyal customer base.

## Real Bodies, Real Confidence

Aerie's no-retouching policy wasn't a temporary campaign — it became the brand's permanent approach to marketing and a core part of its identity. The brand features models across a range of sizes, body types, and backgrounds in all of its advertising, and uses real customer photos alongside professional shoots. This commitment to authenticity resonated powerfully with young women tired of unrealistic beauty standards, and it helped Aerie grow rapidly while many competitors in the intimates space were declining.

## Beyond the Bra

While Aerie started with bras and underwear, the brand has expanded into a full lifestyle offering. The product line now includes leggings, joggers, bike shorts, swimwear, loungewear, and casual clothing. The OFFLINE by Aerie activewear sub-line competes directly with dedicated activewear brands, offering performance fabrics at accessible prices. Across all categories, the emphasis is on comfort, soft fabrics, and designs that make you feel good — both physically and about yourself.

## Aerie in Canada

Aerie operates both standalone stores and shops within American Eagle locations across Canada, along with the Canadian e-commerce site. The brand ships across Canada with CAD pricing and easy returns. For Canadian women and teens looking for comfortable intimates and loungewear from a brand that celebrates how they actually look rather than how they're supposed to look, Aerie offers a refreshing and increasingly rare shopping experience.
