# Mr. Lube

When the first Mr. Lube location opened in Edmonton, Alberta in 1976, the concept was radical for Canada: drive in without an appointment, get your oil changed in minutes, and drive out. No waiting days for a service slot at the dealership. That simple promise of speed and convenience turned Mr. Lube into one of Canada's most recognized automotive service brands.

## The No-Appointment Model

Mr. Lube pioneered the quick-lube format in Canada. Customers pull into a service bay and stay in their vehicle while technicians work from below in a pit-style setup. This drive-through approach eliminated the friction of dropping off a car and arranging alternate transportation. Over the decades, Mr. Lube expanded its services well beyond oil changes to include transmission fluid exchanges, brake inspections, tire rotations, coolant flushes, air conditioning service, and filter replacements. The company built its reputation on transparent pricing, posting service costs clearly so customers know exactly what they are paying before work begins.

## Growth Across Canada

Mr. Lube has grown to over 170 locations across Canada, operating through a franchise model. In 2016, Jiffy Lube's Canadian operations were rebranded under the Mr. Lube name after Mr. Lube's parent company acquired the Canadian franchise rights, further consolidating the brand's position as the country's dominant quick-service automotive chain. The company is now a subsidiary of Driven Brands, one of North America's largest automotive services companies.

## Keeping Canadians on the Road

Mr. Lube technicians are trained in-house through the company's own certification programs. The brand serves a practical need for Canadian drivers who put their vehicles through harsh conditions, from winter salt and cold starts to long highway stretches. With locations spread across every major Canadian city and many smaller communities, Mr. Lube has become the default choice for routine vehicle maintenance for millions of drivers who would rather spend fifteen minutes than half a day on car care.
