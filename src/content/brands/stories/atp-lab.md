# ATP Lab

ATP Lab is a Canadian supplement brand based in Quebec that takes a science-first approach to sports nutrition and health optimization. The company was founded by a team with backgrounds in kinesiology and exercise science who were frustrated by an industry full of proprietary blends, underdosed ingredients, and marketing hype. ATP Lab (named after adenosine triphosphate, the molecule that powers cellular energy) set out to create supplements that are fully transparent, properly dosed, and backed by peer-reviewed research.

## The Science-First Approach

Every ATP Lab product is formulated based on published scientific research, with each ingredient included at the dose shown to be effective in clinical studies — not the smaller, cheaper doses that many supplement brands use to list an ingredient on the label without delivering results. The brand publishes the exact amount of every ingredient on every label, rejecting the "proprietary blend" practice that allows competitors to hide underdosing. This transparency has earned ATP Lab a following among informed consumers, healthcare practitioners, and athletes who understand supplement science.

## The Product Line

ATP Lab's product range spans sports performance, cognitive function, hormonal health, gut health, and general wellness. Key products include Total Strength + Performance (a pre-workout formula), Grass-Fed Whey, Omega Pure (high-potency fish oil), Pentacarb (a carbohydrate blend for endurance athletes), and Optisom (a sleep formula). The brand also produces condition-specific supplements targeting cortisol management, testosterone support, and adrenal health. Products are manufactured in Canada in GMP-certified facilities.

## Trusted by Practitioners

ATP Lab has built particularly strong relationships with naturopathic doctors, kinesiologists, and functional medicine practitioners who recommend the brand's products to patients. This practitioner channel gives the brand a level of clinical credibility that consumer-marketed supplement brands rarely achieve. Products are available through health practitioners, specialty supplement retailers, and the brand's own online store, with shipping across Canada.
