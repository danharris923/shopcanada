# Ardene

What started as a single jewelry counter inside a Montreal department store in 1982 has grown into one of Canada's largest fast-fashion retailers, with over 300 stores across the country and a growing international footprint. Ardene was founded by the Makedonsky family, who spotted a gap in the market for affordable, trend-driven accessories aimed at young women.

## From Jewelry Counter to Fashion Powerhouse

For its first two decades, Ardene (originally called "Ardene Holdings") focused almost exclusively on costume jewelry and hair accessories. The pivot to full apparel came in the early 2000s, when the company began stocking clothing, swimwear, and footwear alongside its accessories. That decision transformed the brand from a niche accessory shop into a head-to-toe fashion destination. Today, the product range spans tops, jeans, dresses, activewear, lingerie, pyjamas, shoes, and of course, the accessories that started it all.

## Headquartered in Montreal

Ardene's head office remains in Montreal, Quebec, where the company employs hundreds of people in design, merchandising, and operations. The brand sources new styles constantly, with fresh arrivals hitting stores and ardene.com on a near-daily basis. Pricing sits firmly in the budget-friendly zone, with most items under $30, making it a go-to for teens and young adults building wardrobes without draining their bank accounts.

## Inclusivity and Expansion

In recent years, Ardene has put real effort into size inclusivity, expanding its range to include extended sizes across most categories. The brand also operates stores in the Middle East and Africa through franchise partnerships, but Canada remains its core market. With locations in malls from British Columbia to Newfoundland, Ardene is one of those distinctly Canadian retailers that most shoppers have walked past, walked into, or walked out of carrying a bag at least once.
