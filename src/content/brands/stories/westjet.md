# WestJet

In 1996, Clive Beddoe and three partners launched WestJet with three Boeing 737s, 220 employees, and five destinations across Western Canada. The Calgary-based airline was modelled after Southwest Airlines, betting that a low-cost, no-frills approach could break the stranglehold that Air Canada held on Canadian aviation. The bet paid off spectacularly.

## From Regional Upstart to National Carrier

WestJet grew quickly through the late 1990s and early 2000s, adding Eastern Canadian cities and eventually international routes to the U.S., Mexico, and the Caribbean. By 2004, the airline had carried its 100-millionth guest. The introduction of WestJet Encore in 2013, a regional subsidiary operating Bombardier Q400 turboprops, pushed the airline into smaller Canadian communities that had long been underserved. Today, WestJet serves over 100 destinations across North America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Europe.

## Culture as a Competitive Advantage

WestJet built its reputation on a distinctly informal, friendly culture. Flight attendants cracking jokes during safety briefings became a signature. The airline's annual Christmas Miracle marketing campaigns, where passengers received surprise gifts at baggage carousels, went viral and cemented WestJet's image as the airline that genuinely cared. Employees were called "WestJetters" and given profit-sharing, creating a motivated workforce that consistently earned the airline top marks in customer satisfaction surveys.

## A New Chapter Under Onex

In 2019, Onex Corporation acquired WestJet for $5 billion, taking the publicly traded airline private. Under new ownership, WestJet has shifted toward a more segmented model with its premium economy and business class offerings. The airline introduced its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet to serve transatlantic routes to cities like London, Paris, Rome, and Edinburgh. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, WestJet remains one of the largest employers in the city and a cornerstone of Canadian aviation.
