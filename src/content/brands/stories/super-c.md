# Super C

Super C is Metro Inc.'s discount grocery banner in Quebec, launched in 1982 to compete directly with no-frills competitors in the province's competitive grocery market. The concept was straightforward: strip away the extras that drive up prices in conventional supermarkets and pass the savings on to shoppers. No fancy displays, no extensive deli counters, just low prices on the products Quebecers buy every week.

## The Quebec Discount Model

Super C operates exclusively in Quebec, with over 90 locations concentrated in the Greater Montreal area and other urban centres across the province. The stores follow the warehouse-style discount format, with products often displayed on pallets and in shipping cases. Customers bag their own groceries, and the stores operate with smaller staff counts than full-service Metro locations. This lean approach allows Super C to offer prices that compete with Maxi (Loblaw's Quebec discount banner) and Walmart Supercentres.

## Part of the Metro Family

As a subsidiary of Metro Inc., Super C benefits from the parent company's massive purchasing power, distribution network, and supply chain infrastructure. While Metro-branded stores target shoppers willing to pay slightly more for a premium experience, Super C captures the price-sensitive segment. This two-banner strategy mirrors what Loblaw does with Loblaws and No Frills, and what Empire does with Sobeys and FreshCo. Each banner has its own identity and customer base, but they share the logistical backbone of a major national grocer.

## Serving Quebec Families

Super C's weekly flyers are a staple of Quebec household planning, with loss-leader promotions on staple items that draw traffic through the doors. The stores stock a full range of grocery products including produce, meat, dairy, bakery, frozen foods, and household goods. Private-label products from the Metro family, including Irresistibles and Selection brands, give shoppers additional savings. For budget-conscious Quebec families, Super C has become as familiar a part of the weekly routine as the depanneur on the corner.
