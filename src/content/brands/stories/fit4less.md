# Fit4Less

Proudly Canadian? So are we! With the goal of helping Canada get fit at an affordable price, Fit4Less opened its first location in Mississauga on a bright and sunny Friday in April 2011. We have continued to expand rapidly, opening 110+ locations across Canada since this day.

No matter where you are, we have a gym conveniently located close to you. As a 100% Canadian owned and operated business, we strive to be a positive member of your community. We want you to feel at home in our friendly, no judgement gyms.

Whether you are looking to get fit, make friends or simply take a load off, Fit4Less has something for everybody. We may not have all the glitz and glam of a boutique gym but your wallet will thank you, trust us!

Not sure where to start? Ask one of our wonderful hosts to show you around and get you comfortable with the gym and all the great benefits Fit4Less has to offer. From our quick and easy 30-Minute Express Circuit ™ to our wide variety of machine and weight options, we will make you feel right at home.
