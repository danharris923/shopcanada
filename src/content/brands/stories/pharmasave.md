# Pharmasave

Pharmasave began in 1981 in British Columbia as a cooperative of independent pharmacy owners who wanted to compete with corporate drugstore chains without giving up their independence. The model was simple: share a brand name, marketing resources, and purchasing power while keeping each store locally owned and operated. That cooperative spirit defines Pharmasave to this day, with over 700 independently owned locations across Canada.

## The Independent Pharmacy Network

What makes Pharmasave different from Shoppers Drug Mart or Rexall is its ownership structure. Every Pharmasave location is owned by a licensed pharmacist or pharmacy professional who lives and works in the community. This means the person behind the counter often knows regular customers by name and can provide genuinely personalized healthcare advice. The stores range from small neighbourhood pharmacies in rural towns to larger locations in suburban plazas, each reflecting the needs of its local community.

## More Than Prescriptions

While pharmacy services remain the core business, Pharmasave stores have expanded into front-shop retail including cosmetics, health and wellness products, vitamins, home health care supplies, and convenience items. The Pharmasave brand products line offers affordable alternatives across many categories. The company also provides clinical pharmacy services including medication reviews, immunizations, smoking cessation programs, and chronic disease management, services that have become increasingly important as Canada's healthcare system evolves.

## Coast to Coast

From its B.C. roots, Pharmasave expanded across Canada and now operates in every province. The brand is particularly strong in smaller communities and rural areas where it may be the only pharmacy in town. Pharmasave Drugs (National) Ltd., headquartered in Langley, British Columbia, provides the central coordination, supply chain management, and marketing support that allows independent pharmacists to focus on patient care while benefiting from the strength of a national brand.
