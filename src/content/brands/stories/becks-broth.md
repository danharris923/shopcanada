# Beck's Broth

Beck's Broth is a Canadian bone broth company founded by Beck, a registered holistic nutritionist, and her business partner Domenique, who brings eco-conscious food industry experience to the operation. The brand was born from a straightforward idea: bone broth is one of the most nourishing foods you can consume, but making it properly at home takes 24 hours of simmering and creates a kitchen full of steam. Beck's Broth set out to make real, high-quality bone broth accessible for daily use without the time commitment.

## The Broth

Beck's Broth produces concentrated bone broth made from grass-fed, pasture-raised bones simmered low and slow to extract maximum collagen, minerals, and amino acids. The broth is available in liquid and powdered formats, making it versatile for sipping straight, adding to soups and stews, or mixing into smoothies and coffee for a protein boost. The recipes are clean-label with no artificial preservatives, MSG, or fillers — just bones, water, vegetables, herbs, and apple cider vinegar to aid mineral extraction.

## Sustainability Built In

Domenique's background in sustainable food systems shaped the brand's approach to packaging and production. Beck's Broth uses eco-friendly packaging wherever possible and sources bones from Canadian farms committed to ethical animal husbandry. The concentrated format also reduces shipping weight and packaging waste compared to ready-to-drink broth cartons, meaning a smaller environmental footprint per serving.

## Nourishing Canadians

Beck's Broth sells through its online store and at select health food retailers and farmers' markets across Canada. The brand has found an audience among health-conscious Canadians who follow paleo, keto, or whole-food diets, as well as athletes looking for a natural collagen and protein source. For anyone who believes in the traditional wisdom of bone broth but doesn't have a full day to tend a stockpot, Beck's Broth delivers the nutrition without the labour.
