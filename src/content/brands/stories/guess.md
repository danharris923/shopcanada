# GUESS

GUESS is an American fashion brand founded in 1981 by the Marciano brothers — Georges, Maurice, Paul, and Armand — who immigrated from France to Los Angeles with a vision for European-influenced American denim. The brand exploded onto the fashion scene with its iconic three-cornered triangle logo and provocative black-and-white advertising featuring supermodels like Claudia Schiffer, Anna Nicole Smith, and Naomi Campbell. GUESS helped define the look of 1980s and 1990s fashion, making designer denim and sexy, confident style accessible to mainstream consumers.

## Denim and Beyond

While GUESS built its empire on jeans, the brand has long since expanded into a full lifestyle label. The current collection spans men's and women's clothing, handbags, watches, eyewear, footwear, jewellery, and fragrances. The brand's aesthetic remains rooted in its LA origins — bold, confident, and unapologetically glamorous. Collections mix European sophistication with American sex appeal, creating pieces that stand out from the understated minimalism that dominates much of contemporary fashion. GUESS leans into colour, pattern, and logo detailing in a way that feels both retro and current.

## Heritage and Revival

Like many brands of its era, GUESS has experienced cycles of cultural relevance, and the current moment represents a strong revival. Nostalgia for 1990s and Y2K fashion has brought the brand back into favour with younger consumers who are discovering its archive for the first time, while loyal customers appreciate the brand's consistency and heritage. The GUESS Originals line specifically taps into vintage designs and limited-edition collaborations that celebrate the brand's most iconic moments.

## GUESS in Canada

GUESS operates retail stores and outlet locations in malls across Canada and ships nationally through its dedicated Canadian site at guess.com/ca.

For fashion-forward Canadians who appreciate bold style with genuine heritage behind it, GUESS continues to deliver the confident, glamorous energy that made it famous over four decades ago.
