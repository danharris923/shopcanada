# Eq State Teas

Our Origin Story The fluorescent boardroom lights buzzed overhead while we argued - again - about how to make tea cheaper. Add artificial flavouring and sweeteners to mask the bland flavour. Use smaller tea particles.“The focus group report is back - they don’t notice the difference.” But I did. As an executive at one of Canada’s largest coffee and tea brands, I watched something sacred turn synthetic, one quarter at a time. The so-called 'wellness' blends on shelves were months old - lifeless dust trapped in plastic sachets that leached microplastics and bleach into every 'healthy' cup.That winter, sick with the flu and craving my mother’s herbal remedy from India, I desperately tried every box on the grocery store shelf. Not one helped.Wrapped in a blanket, throat burning, eyes tearing up, I whispered - “Enough.”So I quit answering my Zoom calls and started blending with my hands.Turmeric stained my countertops gold.Steam fogged the windows.The entire house smelled like cardamom, chamomile, and stubborn hope.Three years. 170 blends.Red-eyed nights studying Ayurveda and traditional medicine until dawn.When friends began begging for refills - calling our teas 'magic' - I knew we’d found it.That’s how EQ State began: not to sell tea, but to restore its soul.
