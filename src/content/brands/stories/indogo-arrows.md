# Indogo Arrows

Indigo Arrows is an Indigenous-led Interior Design and Textile Studio based in Treaty One Territory. Founded by Destiny Seymour, Indigo Arrows takes a critical look at the representation of Indigenous cultures within the built environment.

Destiny launched Indigo Arrows in 2016 to offer something unique in the world of interior design—artisan textiles that respectfully reflect the history of Manitoba’s Indigenous peoples. Indigo Arrows is more than just an interior design company; it's a journey to preserve and honor ancient craftsmanship.

Our collections are inspired by patterns found on pottery and tools dating back 400 to over 3,000 years, connecting spaces today with the stories of the past. For thousands of years, Indigenous peoples in Manitoba, including her Anishinaabe ancestors, created beautiful patterns to adorn their pottery collections and host of bone tools.

Most of the surviving pieces are held by museums now, but Indigo Arrows believes the world needs more than exhibition. We need these patterns in our homes provoking thought; we need them bridging gaps; and, we need them inspiring our loved ones.

Indigo Arrows picks up where our ancestors left off – in the spaces we design and textiles we create. Seymour specializes in the design of Indigenous spaces. Her approach is anchored by community consultations; her designs are informed by local history, current realities, and the needs of future generations; and, her innovative finishes push her clients' spaces ahead of their regional competitors.

Her design mission is to respectfully reflect local Indigenous cultures & identity within architectural forms, interior spaces, furniture, and textiles. This design process acknowledges community engagement, inclusiveness, and collaboration when creating new works.
