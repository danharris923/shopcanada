# Monika Succs

Monika Succs is a Canadian artisan brand specializing in keepsake jewelry and memorial pieces that preserve life's most meaningful moments in wearable form. Despite the playful name — a nod to the succulent plants the founder originally worked with — the brand has evolved into something deeply personal, creating cremation jewelry, breast milk jewelry, and other custom memorial pieces that allow people to carry their loved ones and precious memories close.

## Memorial and Keepsake Jewelry

The brand's core offerings include cremation ash jewelry, where a small amount of a loved one's ashes is incorporated into resin or glass settings within rings, pendants, and bracelets. Breast milk jewelry preserves a mother's breast milk in beautiful stone-like settings, creating a lasting memento of the nursing journey. The line also includes pieces made with pet ashes, flower petals from significant occasions, hair, sand from special beaches, and other meaningful materials. Each piece is handcrafted individually, making every item truly one of a kind.

## The Craft

Every piece of Monika Succs jewelry is handmade in Canada using a meticulous process that ensures the incorporated materials are preserved safely and beautifully within the jewelry setting. The brand works with sterling silver, gold, and rose gold settings, and offers a range of styles from delicate everyday pieces to statement items. Customers submit their materials — whether breast milk, ashes, or other keepsakes — through a secure ordering process, and each piece is crafted with the care and respect that such personal items deserve.

## Carrying Memories Forward

Monika Succs ships across Canada through its online store and has built a devoted community of customers who share their deeply personal stories of why they chose keepsake jewelry. For grieving families, new mothers, and anyone who wants to hold a meaningful moment close, the brand offers something that mass-produced jewelry never can — a piece that holds a real, physical part of a cherished memory.
