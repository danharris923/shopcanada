# Muskoka Roastery Coffee Co.

Muskoka Roastery Coffee Co. was founded in 2000 in Huntsville, Ontario, in the heart of the Muskoka cottage country region that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors from Toronto and beyond every summer. The roastery started as a small operation roasting coffee for local cafes and cottagers, and has grown into one of Ontario's best-known specialty coffee brands. The location isn't just a backdrop — the Muskoka identity is woven into the brand's character, packaging, and marketing, making it inseparable from the cottage country experience.

## The Roastery

Muskoka Roastery sources green beans from coffee-growing regions around the world and roasts them at the Huntsville facility. The roasting team develops profiles for each origin, producing coffees that range from light and fruity to dark and bold. Signature blends carry names that evoke the Muskoka lifestyle — Cottage Roast, Lumberjack, Deck Chair, and Muskoka Moonlight. Single-origin coffees and seasonal releases round out the lineup. The company also offers flavoured coffees, decaf, and K-Cup compatible pods for convenience.

## From Cottage Country to the Coffee Aisle

What started as a cottage-country favourite has expanded into mainstream grocery retail across Ontario and beyond. Muskoka Roastery coffee is now available at major grocery chains including Loblaw, Sobeys, and Metro, as well as at specialty food stores, cafes, and the company's own retail locations in Muskoka. The brand has managed to scale from a small regional roaster to a provincially and nationally distributed brand without losing the artisanal character that built its reputation.

## More Than Coffee

The Muskoka Roastery experience extends beyond bags of beans. The company operates a cafe and retail space in Huntsville that has become a destination for tourists visiting the region. The space showcases the roasting process, offers fresh-brewed coffee and baked goods, and sells branded merchandise. For many visitors, a bag of Muskoka Roastery coffee is as essential a cottage-country souvenir as a jar of local jam or a box of butter tarts.
