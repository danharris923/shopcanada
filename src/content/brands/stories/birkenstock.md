# Birkenstock

Birkenstock is a German footwear brand with roots stretching back to 1774, when Johann Adam Birkenstock was registered as a "subject and shoemaker" in a church archive in Hesse, Germany. The brand is best known for its contoured cork-latex footbed — developed by Konrad Birkenstock in 1896 — which became the foundation for one of the most recognizable sandal designs in the world. After 250 years as a family-owned business, Birkenstock went public in 2023, but the company's commitment to orthopedic footwear engineering remains unchanged.

## The Footbed

Every Birkenstock shoe is built around the brand's signature footbed, which is anatomically shaped to mirror the contours of a healthy foot. The cork-latex base molds to the wearer's foot over time, creating a custom fit that improves with wear. The footbed provides arch support, heel cupping, and toe grip that podiatrists have recommended for decades. This orthopedic foundation is what transforms a simple sandal into a shoe that people with back pain, plantar fasciitis, and other foot issues swear by.

## From Hippie Sandal to Fashion Essential

Birkenstock's cultural journey is remarkable. The Arizona two-strap sandal went from hippie counterculture staple in the 1960s to fashion pariah in the 1990s to one of the most coveted shoes in luxury fashion by the 2020s. Collaborations with designers like Rick Owens, Manolo Blahnik, and Dior transformed Birkenstock's image from granola to high fashion, while the everyday models remained unchanged and affordable. The brand's appearance in the Barbie movie only cemented its cultural ubiquity.

## Birkenstock in Canada

Birkenstock operates a full Canadian website at birkenstock.ca with CAD pricing and local shipping. The shoes are also available at footwear retailers, department stores, and outdoor shops across Canada. For Canadians looking for sandals, clogs, and shoes that deliver genuine orthopedic comfort with a design heritage that spans a quarter of a millennium, Birkenstock is the original and the standard.
