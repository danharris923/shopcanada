# Birch Bark Coffee Company

Birch Bark Coffee Company is a First Nations-owned coffee brand based in Nipissing First Nation, Ontario. Founded by Mark Crowe, a member of Nipissing First Nation, the company roasts premium organic, fair-trade coffee while channeling a portion of proceeds toward Indigenous community initiatives. The brand was built on the belief that a great cup of coffee can also be a vehicle for positive change — connecting consumers to Indigenous communities and causes through their daily coffee ritual.

## The Coffee

Birch Bark sources 100% organic, fair-trade Arabica beans from small-scale farming cooperatives and roasts them in small batches in Ontario. The lineup includes a range of roast profiles from light to dark, as well as flavoured coffees, single-serve pods, and cold brew options. The brand has developed signature blends that reflect the company's connection to the land — names and packaging draw on natural imagery and Indigenous cultural elements. Each blend is crafted to be approachable enough for everyday drinking while maintaining the quality that specialty coffee drinkers expect.

## Indigenous Owned, Community Focused

What distinguishes Birch Bark from other specialty coffee brands is its authentic Indigenous ownership and its commitment to giving back. The company supports Indigenous communities through donations, sponsorships, and partnerships with organizations focused on education, clean water, and youth programs. Birch Bark has also created employment opportunities within Nipissing First Nation and surrounding communities, contributing to economic self-determination. The brand has been featured in national media and has won recognition as a leading Indigenous-owned business in Canada.

## Available Across Canada

Birch Bark Coffee is available online through its own shop and through retail partners, offices, and institutions across Canada. The company offers wholesale programs for businesses, hotels, and organizations looking to serve Indigenous-owned products. The brand has also expanded into corporate gifting and custom-branded coffee programs. For consumers, Birch Bark offers an easy way to enjoy excellent coffee while supporting Indigenous enterprise.
