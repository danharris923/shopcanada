# Skinfix

More Than Skincare—This Is Skinfix The state of your skin can impact how you feel about connecting with others, taking adventures, and experiencing what brings you joy. We get it, because we’ve been there.

Behind Skinfix is a team of skintellectuals: science-obsessed beauty industry veterans motivated by empathy and urgency. We create clean, clinical, high-impact formulas because that’s what delivers real results.

Let's Do It Differently When We Say Clean We mean avoiding ingredients that are well known to irritate the skin, cause allergies, or have been linked to environmental harm. Sometimes, we even say no to ingredients that are safe, but may clog pores or aggravate certain forms of acne.

To us, being clean isn't about following a set of random rules—it’s based on input from our dermatologist community, recommendations from non-profit orgs like the National Eczema Association (NEA) or National Rosacea Society (NRS), and the latest research.

We also know that what’s considered clean can change over time, so we keep reviewing and updating based on the latest science. Not every natural ingredient is good for your skin, and not every synthetic one is bad.

Review our "No" list here. When We Say Clinical We’re talking about products that are based on solid science—the kind of skincare that professionals trust, because it works. While non-clinical options might use just enough of an active ingredient to call out on a label, clinical formulas use them only at concentrations that have been studied and proven to be effective.

We also hold our products to higher regulatory standards, with strict guidelines for quality and manufacturing. Skinfix products are rigorously tested, peer-reviewed in medical journals, and even used in clinical practice to support both prescription and non-prescription routines.

For many derms, Skinfix is the only clean brand they trust and recommend. We don’t take that trust lightly. When We Say High-Impact We get that skincare isn’t the only thing you think about—or budget for.

Each of our high-performance formulas is packed with up to 10 active ingredients, thoughtfully chosen to address multiple, often-connected concerns. Importantly, powerful doesn’t mean harsh. For over a decade, Skinfix has led the way in barrier health, because we know a compromised barrier isn’t just uncomfortable—it’s often the reason stubborn skin issues stick around.

That’s why even our hardest-working treatments are designed to support long-term health, delivering visible results now and stronger skin over time. How It All Started The story of Skinfix began when our founder Amy Gordinier—a beauty industry executive for over 20 years—moved to a small town in eastern Canada to raise her children.

There, she discovered a 150-year-old skin-healing balm created by a compound pharmacist. She was struck by its high concentration of efficacious ingredients—far more potent than modern products.
