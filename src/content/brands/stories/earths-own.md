# Earths Own

Earth’s Own is a proudly Canadian brand, based in Burnaby, BC. We produce all our milks and creamers in three cities across the country: our Western Canadian facility is located on Annacis Island in Delta, BC, and our Eastern Canadian facilities are in Mississauga, ON, and Quebec City, QC.

We’re proudly Canadian and will continue to support our amazing country the best we possibly can. Enjoying any glass of almond or oat m*lk is better for the planet. They all use less water. Less land.

And they all produce less carbon. Ours is just voted the best! Our oat m*lks (plus oat baristas & oat coffee creamers! ) are made with 100% Canadian-grown oats from Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

We are obsessed with plants! Why? Because by eating them, collectively we can cut our carbon foodprint by up to half! We love them so much, even our cartons are made from plants! We do things differently at Earth’s Own.

We’re bold. We’re tenacious. We’re purpose-led. Plant-based isn’t a fad or a trendy hashtag to us – it’s about uniting the people and brands who are out there working to change the world. People that are obsessed with plants, just like us!
