# Indigo

Indigo is Canada's largest book, gift, and lifestyle retailer, operating over 160 locations across the country under the Indigo, Chapters, and Coles banners. Founded in 1996 by Heather Reisman in Toronto, the company grew through the acquisition of Chapters in 2001 to become the dominant bookstore chain in Canada. Indigo has evolved far beyond books, positioning itself as a "cultural department store" that sells home decor, wellness products, stationery, toys, and curated gifts alongside its extensive book selection.

## More Than a Bookstore

While books remain central to Indigo's identity, the stores have transformed into lifestyle destinations. The product mix now includes candles, journals, wellness accessories, baby products, puzzles, games, and home decor — all curated with the same editorial sensibility that drives book selection. The IndigoKids section offers a carefully chosen selection of children's books, toys, and educational products. The company's buying team treats every product category with the same curatorial approach: items are selected not just for commercial potential but for how they fit into a thoughtful, culture-forward lifestyle.

## Indigo Love of Reading Foundation

Indigo's charitable arm, the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation, has donated millions of dollars to high-needs schools across Canada, putting books into the hands of children who need them most. The foundation has become one of the largest funders of children's literacy programs in the country, reflecting Reisman's belief that access to books is fundamental to opportunity.

## Canada's Cultural Retailer

Indigo operates stores from coast to coast and a full e-commerce platform at indigo.ca. The brand has navigated the challenges facing brick-and-mortar retail by creating stores that people want to visit — warm, browsable spaces that feel more like community gathering spots than commercial retail. For Canadians who love books, beautiful objects, and the experience of browsing in a well-curated store, Indigo remains an essential part of the cultural landscape.
