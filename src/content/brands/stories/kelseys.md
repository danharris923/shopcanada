# Kelseys

Kelseys Original Roadhouse opened its first location in 1978 in Oakville, Ontario, positioning itself as a neighbourhood bar and grill where families, friends, and sports fans could gather over casual food and cold beer. The brand leaned into a roadhouse theme with rustic decor, generous portions, and a menu built around comfort food staples like burgers, ribs, wings, and pasta. The concept hit the right note in the expanding Canadian casual dining market.

## Part of Recipe Unlimited

Kelseys is owned by Recipe Unlimited Corporation (formerly Cara Operations), Canada's largest full-service restaurant company. Within the Recipe portfolio — which includes Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, The Keg, Montana's, Milestones, and East Side Mario's — Kelseys fills the family-friendly, mid-priced casual dining slot. The Recipe ownership provides shared infrastructure for supply chain, marketing, and real estate, which has helped Kelseys maintain a consistent presence even as independent casual dining restaurants have struggled with rising costs.

## The Menu and Atmosphere

The Kelseys menu centres on crowd-pleasers: slow-smoked ribs, hand-pressed burgers, loaded nachos, flatbreads, and a rotating selection of seasonal features. The bar program includes a solid draft beer selection, cocktails, and game-day specials that drive traffic during hockey and football seasons. The restaurants are designed with an open, energetic feel — exposed brick, sports screens, and booth-heavy layouts that accommodate everything from Tuesday wing nights to Saturday family dinners.

## Across Ontario and Beyond

Kelseys operates approximately 25 locations, primarily concentrated in Ontario with a few outposts in other provinces. The brand has found its strongest foothold in suburban communities and smaller cities where it serves as a reliable gathering spot. While the Canadian casual dining landscape has contracted in recent years, Kelseys has maintained its identity by focusing on value, portion size, and the kind of familiar atmosphere that keeps regulars coming back week after week.
