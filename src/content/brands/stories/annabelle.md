# Annabelle

Our Story Annabelle Brand Story Annabelle was born in August of 1967. It was one of the most dazzlingly colourful summers in history, with all eyes on the cosmopolitan city of Montréal, who was playing host to the World’s Fair.The Fair was a kaleidoscope of cultural diversity, and a vibrant, visionary celebration of humanity.A sense explosive human potential was spreading like wildfire from the hippie love-ins of San Francisco to the ivory towers of academia in Paris.As a child of that era, Annabelle captured both its vibrant colour and its message of empowerment with the notion of Colour Power. We built a reputation for its extraordinary variety of bold shades and nuanced hues, created to inspire women to freely experiment and express their own powerful and colourful sense of personal style.Today, nearly fifty years later, the power of self-expression has reached a whole new level as women of all ages and backgrounds celebrate and share their beauty and strength on Youtube, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram. The faces and messages of the beauty industry are changing for the positive, and we’re excited to be a part of that change.Our Colour Power is stronger than ever, and it’s our dream to help women everywhere find and have fun expressing a power all their own. Annabelle believes that it’s not the way you look that counts – it’s how you look at the world. A strong connection to what makes us unique is what makes us truly beautiful. And when we bring that beauty light, it can turn even the most ordinary day into something powerfully beautiful.
