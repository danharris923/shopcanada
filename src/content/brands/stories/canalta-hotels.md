# Canalta Hotels

About Canalta Family Owned and Operated Headquartered in Drumheller, Alberta, Canalta Hotels is a family owned and operated Canadian company, employing over 3000 people across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.Since 1974, Canalta Hotels’ founders, Cam and Sharlene Christianson, along with their sons Blair and Brooke Christianson, have dedicated their professional lives to building a genuine company based on the principles of hard work and service excellence.What began as one motor inn in Stettler, Alberta, gradually grew into a wider network and today, Canalta Hotels owns and operates more than 40 properties across Western Canada.The Christianson family’s never-give-up work ethic and “I-can’t-believe-they-did-that” service philosophy are what makes Canalta stand out in a category filled with jaded, impersonal service.That’s why the core values we hold at the center of our business operations are not forced or invented—They’re in our DNA Canalta History Canalta Cares Canalta is committed to our communities, the environment and standing for the right thing!
