# Pestle & Pods

Pestle & Pods is a Canadian food brand that simplifies cooking with pre-portioned spice and seasoning pods designed to take the guesswork out of home meal preparation. Each pod contains the exact spice blend needed for a specific dish or cuisine, eliminating the need to measure individual spices and ensuring consistent results every time. The concept is aimed at home cooks who want flavourful meals but don't have the time, confidence, or pantry space for dozens of individual spice jars.

## How It Works

Each Pestle & Pods seasoning pod is pre-measured for a specific recipe — one pod seasons one dish for four to six servings. The pods cover a range of cuisines and dishes, from taco seasoning and curry blends to Mediterranean herb mixes and Asian stir-fry seasonings. The recipes are printed on the packaging, making it easy for even novice cooks to produce restaurant-quality meals at home. The spices are blended fresh and sealed in individual pods to preserve flavour and potency.

## Clean Ingredients

Pestle & Pods uses whole, natural spices without MSG, fillers, anti-caking agents, or artificial flavours — the additives that are common in commercial seasoning packets. The ingredient lists are short and transparent, and the company sources quality spices for each blend. The products are also designed to accommodate dietary preferences, with many blends being naturally gluten-free, vegan, and suitable for various eating styles.

## Canadian Kitchen Essential

Pestle & Pods sells through its online store and at select retailers across Canada. The brand has found a following among busy families, new cooks learning their way around the kitchen, and experienced home chefs who appreciate the convenience of pre-measured portions for weeknight cooking. The pods also make practical gifts for housewarmings, student care packages, and anyone setting up a new kitchen.
