# Danier

Danier Leather was founded in 1972 by Jeffrey Wortsman in Toronto as a leather goods retailer specializing in jackets, coats, bags, and accessories. For decades, Danier was Canada's go-to destination for leather outerwear, operating over 80 stores across the country in malls and shopping centres. The brand built its reputation on offering high-quality leather at prices below luxury designer labels, filling a niche between fast fashion and premium European leather houses. A Danier leather jacket was a wardrobe staple for a generation of Canadians.

## Rise and Fall of the Original

At its peak, Danier was a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange, with annual revenues exceeding $160 million. The stores were fixtures in Canadian malls, known for their seasonal sales events that drew crowds. However, the company struggled as consumer preferences shifted away from leather, mall traffic declined, and fast fashion brands offered cheaper alternatives. After years of declining sales, Danier filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016 and closed all of its retail locations, marking the end of a Canadian retail era.

## The Revival

The Danier brand was acquired out of bankruptcy and relaunched as an online-first retailer. The new Danier maintains the brand's association with leather goods while updating the product range and business model for the modern era. The revived brand sells leather jackets, bags, wallets, and accessories through its e-commerce platform, aiming to capture the nostalgia of loyal Danier customers while attracting a new generation. The product line has expanded to include non-leather items alongside the core leather offerings.

## A Canadian Legacy

The Danier name carries significant weight in Canadian retail history. For many Canadians, their first "real" leather jacket came from Danier. The brand's revival as an online retailer represents a broader trend of legacy Canadian brands finding new life in the digital era, though the challenge of rebuilding consumer trust and brand relevance after a bankruptcy remains significant. The new operation ships across Canada, offering free shipping on orders over $100.
