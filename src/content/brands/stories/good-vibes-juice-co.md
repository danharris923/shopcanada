# Good Vibes Juice Co.

Good Vibes Juice Co. is a Canadian cold-pressed juicery based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, that creates beverages harnessing the natural benefits of fruits, vegetables, teas, and herbs. The company started with a local juice bar and gained a following for its wellness shots — particularly the SICK DAY shot, a potent blend of echinacea and ginger first introduced in 2016 that became so popular with customers that Good Vibes expanded into packaged products to reach a wider market.

## Wellness in a Shot

Good Vibes' signature product line centres on concentrated wellness shots designed to deliver potent natural ingredients in a convenient, quick-to-consume format. The SICK DAY shot combines echinacea, ginger, and other immune-supporting ingredients for seasonal wellness. The GET WELL and TURMERIC DAILY shots round out the lineup, offering targeted formulations for recovery and daily anti-inflammatory support. Each shot uses cold-pressed extraction to preserve the nutritional integrity of the ingredients.

## Cold-Pressed Quality

The company cold-presses its juices and shots using hydraulic press technology, which extracts maximum nutrients from fruits and vegetables without the heat and oxidation that conventional juicers produce. This process preserves vitamins, enzymes, and minerals that would otherwise be destroyed, resulting in a more nutritionally dense product. Good Vibes uses no artificial preservatives, added sugars, or fillers — each product contains only the natural ingredients listed on the label.

## From Kitchener-Waterloo to Canada

Good Vibes Juice Co. sells through its online store and at select retailers in Ontario and beyond. The brand operates under the philosophy "let food be thy friend," encouraging customers to incorporate natural, plant-based nutrition into their daily routines through convenient, delicious formats. For Canadians looking for a quick, effective way to boost their daily intake of natural immune-supporting and anti-inflammatory ingredients, Good Vibes makes wellness simple and accessible.
