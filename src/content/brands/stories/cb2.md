# CB2

CB2 is the younger, bolder sibling brand of Crate & Barrel, launched in 2000 to target urban dwellers and design-forward consumers who want modern furniture and decor with more edge and personality than traditional home retailers offer. While Crate & Barrel leans toward timeless and approachable, CB2 pushes into more daring design territory — sharper angles, bolder colours, unexpected materials, and pieces that make a statement in a room.

## Bold, Modern Design

CB2's product range includes furniture, lighting, rugs, wall art, and decorative accessories with a distinctly urban, contemporary aesthetic. The designs pull from architectural modernism, industrial elements, and global influences, creating pieces that feel curated and intentional. Materials like terrazzo, brass, smoked glass, marble, and velvet appear frequently across collections. The overall look is sophisticated and editorial — the kind of furniture you see in design magazines and loft apartments, available at prices that are premium but not prohibitive for the quality and design.

## City Living, Designed

CB2 designs with urban space constraints in mind. Many pieces are scaled for apartments and condos rather than sprawling suburban homes, and the brand offers modular furniture systems, multi-functional pieces, and space-efficient designs that maximize livability in smaller footprints. This urban focus makes CB2 particularly relevant in Canadian cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, where condo living is a reality for many young professionals and the furniture needs to work harder in tighter spaces.

## CB2 in Canada

CB2 operates a Canadian website at cb2.ca with CAD pricing and local shipping, alongside retail showrooms in select Canadian cities. For Canadians who want their home to reflect a modern, design-conscious sensibility — the kind of space that feels like it was curated rather than furnished — CB2 offers the design ambition and quality that sits above mass-market retailers while remaining accessible to people who don't have unlimited decorating budgets.
