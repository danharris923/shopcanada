# Charm Diamond Centres

Company History From the moment you say, ‘yes’ your engagement ring becomes a beautiful symbol of the one you promise to love forever. It’s a token of the memories you have and the memories you’ll make together for a lifetime.

For 50 years, Charm Diamond Centres has been honoured to help Canadians create and celebrate love stories that span generations. Founded in 1972 By Richard Calder, Charm Diamond Centres began as a love story, rooted in a passion for jewellery and celebrating love.

Specializing in charms and fine jewellery, our first store opened in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and has grown to over 60 stores across Canada. To this day, our Charm name shines bright, as Canada's largest independently owned and family operated jeweller.

From the beginning, Calder’s mission has been to, “Win the Customer for Life. ” He believes providing excellent customer service and quality jewellery, at the best price, is the key to making that happen.

Calder has spent his life searching and creating the world’s best bridal offerings for the Canadian Bride. As a proud Canadian, Richard has also led the way in Canadian Diamonds, being one of the first retailers to introduce them to the world.

Charm Diamonds now proudly features Canada’s largest selection of Canadian diamonds, including Calder’s exclusive Canadian Diamond bridal collection, Charmed by Richard Calder. Whether you’re looking for a symbolic gift to celebrate your love or a sparkling gift to celebrate a special moment in time, the staff at Charm Diamond Centres is thrilled to be a part of your love story, because love starts here.
