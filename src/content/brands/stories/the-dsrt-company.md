# The DSRT Company

The DSRT Company is a Canadian food brand that creates healthier versions of classic desserts and sweet treats. The brand's name — "dessert" without the vowels — signals its philosophy: all the indulgence of dessert with some of the less desirable ingredients stripped away. The company produces cookies, baking mixes, and other sweet products formulated to be lower in sugar, higher in protein, and free from many of the artificial ingredients found in conventional baked goods, all while tasting like the real thing.

## Better-For-You Baking

The DSRT Company's product line includes ready-to-eat cookies, cookie dough, brownie mixes, and pancake mixes that use alternative ingredients to improve the nutritional profile without sacrificing the taste and texture people crave. Recipes incorporate plant-based proteins, natural sweeteners, and whole-food ingredients to deliver treats that satisfy a sweet tooth while fitting into health-conscious lifestyles. The products are designed for people who don't want to choose between eating well and enjoying dessert.

## Clean Ingredients

Every DSRT product is formulated with a clean ingredient list — no artificial colours, flavours, or preservatives. The brand caters to various dietary needs with options that are gluten-free, vegan, and allergen-friendly across different product lines. The focus on transparency means customers can read the ingredient list and understand every item on it, a contrast to the lengthy chemical lists on many "healthy" snack brands that are healthy in name only.

## Canadian Sweet Tooth

The DSRT Company sells through its online store and at select retailers across Canada. The brand has found a loyal customer base among Canadians who follow macro-conscious, keto, or generally healthier eating patterns but refuse to give up dessert entirely. For anyone who believes that a healthier lifestyle shouldn't mean a life without cookies, The DSRT Company offers a genuinely satisfying middle ground.
