# Eatable

Eatable is a Canadian gourmet popcorn brand that elevates popcorn from a movie-night snack to a premium gifting and entertaining product. The company produces handcrafted flavoured popcorn in sophisticated combinations that pair popcorn with wine, spirits, and cocktail flavours — think Rosé All Day (rosé wine-infused), Cinnamon Toast Crunch (bourbon-inspired), and Truffle Parmesan. The concept turns a humble snack into something worthy of a dinner party, wine night, or curated gift box.

## The Flavours

Eatable's flavour development pushes popcorn into unexpected territory. Each variety is crafted to complement specific beverages — wine pairings, cocktail-inspired combinations, and beer-friendly seasoning profiles. The popcorn is air-popped, then coated or seasoned with premium ingredients to achieve each flavour. The lineup rotates seasonally, with limited-edition flavours creating anticipation among loyal customers. The brand avoids artificial colours and flavours, using real ingredients to build its flavour profiles.

## Gift-Worthy Packaging

A significant part of Eatable's appeal is the packaging. The popcorn comes in beautifully designed bags, boxes, and gift sets that look premium enough to bring to a housewarming, include in a gift basket, or set out at an event. This gift-positioning has been central to the brand's growth, particularly around holidays like Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Mother's Day. The packaging design is clean and contemporary, signalling "premium snack" rather than "gas station popcorn."

## Canadian and Available Nationally

Eatable is Canadian-made and available through its online store, at specialty food retailers, and at select grocery chains across Canada. The brand has also expanded into corporate gifting, offering branded popcorn boxes for companies. In the growing premium snack category, Eatable has found a niche by transforming popcorn — one of the most affordable and universally loved snacks — into something elevated, share-worthy, and distinctly Canadian.
