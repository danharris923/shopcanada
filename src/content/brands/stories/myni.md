# Myni

your cleaning and personal care products don't have to be trash we found the solution! we use science to find alternatives to commonly used products Myni means... Myni (pronounced mini). A bit in the essence of the proverb "Small but mighty", we want to contrast the great impact of small green actions.

before everything real people doing the real work . Our Myni story Marie-Hélène David founded the company in 2020 with a goal of making safe, natural products accessible to families and the planet. The idea came to her the day she realized that her sink pipe had been corroded by the toxic fumes from her cleaning products.

At that time, she undertook a journey to learn about the nature of the ingredients found in traditional cleaning products. The conclusion was clear: most cleaning products are harmful to the health of our families as well as our beautiful planet.

All too often, traditional products contain carcinogenic ingredients. Also, in addition to making the consumer pay for water, transporting these liquids all over the planet has a very negative impact on CO2 emissions.

What’s worse is the number of plastic bottles that are used once and then discarded. It was for this reason that Myni was born with the mission of reducing the environmental impact of the household and personal products we use, while offering a product safe for the whole family.

We hope you have as much fun using our product lines as we had creating them! Marie-Helene David, Founder Since 2020 we’ve been working to create meaningful impact.
