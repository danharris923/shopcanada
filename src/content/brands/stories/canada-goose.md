# Canada Goose

Sam Tick founded Metro Sportswear Ltd. in a small warehouse in Toronto in 1957, making wool vests, raincoats, and snowmobile suits. His son-in-law, David Reiss, joined the business in the 1970s and developed a custom-fit down-filling machine that allowed the company to produce high-performance down parkas. The brand was renamed Canada Goose in 2000 under the leadership of Reiss's son, Dani Reiss, who transformed a modest Canadian outerwear manufacturer into a global luxury brand worth billions.

## From Arctic Expeditions to City Streets

Canada Goose jackets were originally built for people who actually needed extreme cold protection: Antarctic researchers, Arctic Rangers, and sled dog racers in the Iditarod. The brand's association with genuine polar exploration gave it an authenticity that competitors could not replicate. Dani Reiss's stroke of genius was recognizing that this functional credibility could translate into urban fashion. By the mid-2000s, Canada Goose parkas had become status symbols on the streets of Toronto, New York, and London, worn as much for their brand cachet as for their warmth.

## Made in Canada

Canada Goose maintained its commitment to manufacturing in Canada even as most fashion brands moved production overseas. The company operates multiple factories across the country, employing thousands of Canadian workers. This "Made in Canada" positioning became central to the brand's identity and marketing, distinguishing it from competitors who manufacture offshore. The company went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange in 2017, and at its peak, Canada Goose had a market capitalization exceeding $7 billion.

## Expanding Beyond Parkas

What began as a parka company has expanded into lightweight down jackets, knitwear, footwear, and accessories. Canada Goose operates flagship stores in Toronto, Montreal, New York, London, Tokyo, and Beijing, among others. The brand also launched a sustainability initiative including a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Despite facing controversies around pricing, animal welfare (the brand stopped using fur in 2022), and geopolitical tensions, Canada Goose remains one of Canada's most recognized brands globally.
