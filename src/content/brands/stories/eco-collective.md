# Eco Collective

Eco Collective is a Canadian wellness and beauty brand founded by Genevieve, who transitioned from a career in conventional business to building a company rooted in slow living, sustainability, and mindful self-care. The brand began at farmers' markets and has grown into a recognized name in the plastic-free beauty and zero-waste personal care space. Eco Collective creates products designed to replace single-use plastics in the bathroom and beauty routine — solid shampoo bars, conditioner bars, deodorant, lip balm, and body care — all formulated without synthetic chemicals.

## Plastic-Free Beauty

Eco Collective's mission centres on eliminating plastic waste from personal care routines. The product range is packaged in compostable, recyclable, or reusable containers — no single-use plastic anywhere in the line. Shampoo and conditioner bars eliminate the need for plastic bottles entirely, while solid deodorants come in compostable tubes or refillable tins. The formulations are free from parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, and palm oil. Each product is designed to perform as well as or better than conventional alternatives, addressing the common concern that "eco-friendly" products require sacrificing quality.

## Mindful Rituals

Beyond the products themselves, Eco Collective promotes the concept of slow, intentional self-care. The brand encourages customers to treat daily routines — washing hair, applying moisturizer, brushing teeth — as mindful rituals rather than tasks to rush through. This philosophy extends to the brand's visual identity, which uses calming colours, natural textures, and thoughtful packaging design. Gift sets and curated bundles are designed to introduce people to plastic-free alternatives gradually rather than demanding an overnight overhaul.

## Canadian and Growing

Eco Collective products are handmade in Canada and sold through the brand's online store, at farmers' markets, and through select retailers. The brand has built a community around sustainable living, sharing tips on reducing waste and making intentional choices. For Canadians looking to reduce their environmental footprint starting with their daily routine, Eco Collective offers an accessible entry point into plastic-free personal care.
