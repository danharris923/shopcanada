# Devon & Lang

Devon & Lang is a Canadian underwear brand that designs comfortable, everyday basics for both men and women. The brand was built on the belief that great underwear shouldn't be complicated — it should fit well, feel soft, last through hundreds of washes, and come at a fair price. Devon & Lang strips away the marketing hype and premium pricing that characterizes much of the underwear industry and focuses instead on the fundamentals: quality fabric, thoughtful construction, and a fit that works for real bodies.

## The Product

Devon & Lang's core product is everyday underwear in classic styles — boxer briefs and briefs for men, bikini and boyshort styles for women. The brand uses premium cotton and modal blends chosen for softness, breathability, and durability. The waistbands are designed to stay comfortable without digging in or rolling, and the construction is reinforced at stress points to prevent premature wear. The colour palette tends toward classic solids and simple patterns, reflecting the brand's no-fuss aesthetic.

## Canadian Pride

The brand leans into its Canadian identity, with "Proud to be Canadian" as a core part of its messaging. Devon & Lang appeals to consumers who want to support Canadian businesses with their everyday purchases. The pricing is positioned to be accessible — competitive with department store brands but offering better quality and fit. Multi-pack options make it easy for customers to refresh their entire underwear drawer at once without a significant financial commitment.

## Direct to You

Devon & Lang sells primarily through its online store, shipping across Canada. The direct-to-consumer model keeps costs down by eliminating retail markup, allowing the brand to offer better value than comparable products sold through department stores or specialty retailers. The brand has built its following through straightforward messaging that resonates with Canadians who want quality basics without paying for brand prestige or flashy advertising campaigns.
