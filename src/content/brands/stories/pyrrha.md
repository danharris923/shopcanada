# Pyrrha

Pyrrha is a Vancouver-based jewellery brand founded in 1995 by Wade Papin and Danielle Wilmore. The brand is known worldwide for its talisman jewellery — pieces cast from authentic 18th and 19th century wax seals that carry symbolic meanings drawn from heraldic traditions. Each talisman features a different image and motto, allowing wearers to choose pieces that reflect their personal values, intentions, and life stories. Pyrrha has grown from a small Vancouver studio into one of Canada's most internationally recognized jewellery brands.

## Talisman Jewellery

Every Pyrrha talisman begins with a genuine antique wax seal — the kind once used to seal letters and mark documents with personal insignia. Papin and Wilmore have amassed one of the world's largest collections of these historical seals, and each one is used to cast jewellery in sterling silver, 14k gold, and bronze using the lost-wax casting method. The resulting pieces carry intricate, centuries-old designs depicting animals, plants, celestial bodies, and Latin mottos with meanings like "trust the universe," "new beginnings," and "live every moment."

## Zero-Carbon Studio

Pyrrha handcrafts every piece from start to finish in its Vancouver studio, which the company built as a certified zero-carbon facility. The building uses cross-laminated timber construction and sustainable design principles, and the studio uses 100% recycled precious metals for casting. Sustainability isn't an afterthought for Pyrrha — it's built into the physical structure of where the jewellery is made. The brand has been recognized as one of the most sustainable jewellery companies in the world.

## Global Reach, Vancouver Roots

Pyrrha sells through its own retail locations, its online store, and hundreds of retailers across North America and internationally. The brand has collaborated with major entertainment properties and cultural institutions, bringing its talisman concept to wider audiences while maintaining the handcrafted Vancouver production that defines its identity. For Canadians who want jewellery that carries real meaning, real history, and a genuine commitment to sustainability, Pyrrha offers something truly distinctive.
