# LUNA Grooming Co.

LUNA Grooming Co. is a Canadian-made men's grooming brand that creates premium hair styling and care products designed to deliver barbershop-quality results at home. The brand was built for men who take their hair seriously — those who want products that provide strong hold, natural finish, and all-day performance without the crunchy, flaky, or greasy results that cheap styling products deliver. Every product is formulated and manufactured in Canada.

## The Product Line

LUNA's range covers the core styling needs of modern men. The lineup includes pomades in various hold strengths (light to strong), hair clay for matte textured looks, styling cream for natural flow, and sea salt spray for casual volume. Each product is designed for a specific hair type and desired finish — pomade for slick, classic looks; clay for textured, separated styles; cream for soft, natural movement. The formulations wash out easily with water, avoiding the buildup problems associated with petroleum-based products.

## Quality Ingredients

LUNA uses quality ingredients selected for both performance and hair health. The products are free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and petroleum — ingredients common in bargain-bin hair gels and waxes. Instead, LUNA relies on natural waxes, butters, and botanical extracts that style hair effectively while conditioning it. The scent profiles are sophisticated and masculine, developed to be pleasant without being overpowering — the kind of subtle fragrance that draws a compliment rather than clearing a room.

## For the Modern Man

LUNA Grooming Co. sells through its online store and through select barbershops and retailers across Canada. The brand has built its following among style-conscious Canadian men who have graduated from drugstore hair products and want something that performs at a higher level. The packaging is clean and masculine, designed to look good on a bathroom shelf. In the growing Canadian men's grooming market, LUNA competes on product quality and results rather than celebrity endorsements or massive advertising budgets.
