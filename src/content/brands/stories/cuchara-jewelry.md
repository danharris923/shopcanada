# Cuchara

Cuchara is a Toronto-based jewellery brand started by designer Edi Candeo, who first began creating pieces by repurposing vintage spoons in Victoria, British Columbia. The name "cuchara" means "spoon" in Spanish — a nod to those original creations that launched the brand. What started as a small, creative project working with found silverware has grown into a full jewellery collection, but the spirit of resourcefulness, intention, and handcraft that defined those early spoon pieces remains at the core of everything Cuchara makes.

## Designed with Intention

Cuchara's collection includes earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets crafted from sterling silver, gold-fill, and brass. The designs balance organic, handworked textures with clean contemporary lines — pieces that feel artisanal but not costumey. Many items incorporate natural stones, freshwater pearls, and found materials that give each piece character. The aesthetic leans toward the understated and wearable, with a warmth and imperfection that comes from human hands rather than machine precision.

## Women-Owned, Small-Batch

Cuchara is proudly women-owned and operated, producing jewellery in small batches from the Toronto studio. Edi and her team handle design, production, and fulfillment in-house, maintaining creative control and quality oversight at every stage. The small-batch approach means limited quantities of each design, and it means each piece receives individual attention during production. The brand is committed to ethical sourcing and minimal waste, repurposing materials and using recycled metals wherever possible.

## From Spoons to Statement

Cuchara sells through its online store and at select retailers and markets across Canada. The brand has earned a loyal following among Canadians who appreciate jewellery with a story, a point of view, and a human touch. For anyone who wants accessories that feel personal and purposeful rather than mass-produced, Cuchara delivers pieces that carry the creativity and care of their maker in every detail.
