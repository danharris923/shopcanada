# Mangata Apothecary

Stefanie Henderlin founded Mangata Apothecary in Delta, British Columbia, drawing on her background as a registered midwife and certified herbalist. The name "mangata" is a Swedish word describing the reflection of moonlight on water — a poetic nod to the natural world that inspires the brand's formulations. What started as a small family operation creating herbal remedies for maternal health has expanded into a full apothecary line of botanical balms, aromatherapy rollers, and skin care products.

## Rooted in Herbalism

Mangata Apothecary's product line reflects Henderlin's training in herbal medicine and her experience supporting women through pregnancy, postpartum recovery, and breastfeeding. The Botanical Bump Balm and lactation support products were among the brand's first offerings, filling a gap in the market for natural, plant-based maternal care products made by someone with clinical expertise. Each formula uses botanical ingredients selected for their therapeutic properties, from calendula and chamomile to lavender and frankincense.

## The Product Range

Beyond maternal care, Mangata has expanded into everyday wellness. The roller collection features essential oil blends designed for stress relief, better sleep, headache management, and mood support. The balm line covers skin care needs from dry skin repair to muscle tension. All products are handmade in small batches in British Columbia, using natural ingredients without synthetic fragrances, parabens, or petroleum-based fillers. The brand also offers herbal consultations where Henderlin creates personalized wellness plans for clients.

## Small Batch, Big Heart

Mangata Apothecary sells direct through its online shop and through select retailers. The brand also works with wholesale partners through the Faire marketplace. Despite its small-batch approach, Mangata has built a dedicated following among parents, wellness-focused consumers, and anyone looking for natural alternatives to conventional body care products. Henderlin continues to balance her work as a herbalist and lactation consultant with growing the brand.
