# Lulus

Lulus is an American online fashion retailer founded in 1996 in Chico, California, that has become one of the internet's most popular destinations for occasion wear, dresses, and wedding-related fashion. The brand started as a vintage clothing shop run by mother-daughter duo Debra Cannon and Colleen Winter, and has evolved into a major e-commerce player known for affordable dresses that look far more expensive than they are. Lulus has become the first stop for millions of women shopping for wedding guest outfits, prom dresses, bridesmaid options, and date night looks.

## The Dress Destination

Lulus is best known for its enormous selection of dresses — from cocktail and formal gowns to casual sundresses and everything in between. The brand produces many of its own designs in-house, which allows it to offer on-trend styles at prices significantly below comparable dresses from department stores. The selection is particularly strong in occasion wear: wedding guest dresses, homecoming and prom options, New Year's Eve outfits, and the kind of special-event clothing that women typically struggle to find without spending a fortune.

## Affordable Style

Price is a major part of the Lulus appeal. Most dresses fall in the $40 to $120 range, with even formal gowns rarely exceeding $200. The brand achieves this by designing in-house, managing its own production, and selling direct to consumer through its website. Quality is calibrated to the price point — these are well-constructed garments that look great for their intended purpose, whether that's a single-wear formal event or a summer dress you'll wear all season.

## Shipping to Canada

Lulus ships to Canada with flat-rate shipping of $9.99 CAD, and offers free shipping on orders over $99 USD. The brand has a devoted Canadian following among women who appreciate the combination of style, selection, and value — particularly for those moments when you need a specific dress for a specific event and the local options aren't cutting it.
