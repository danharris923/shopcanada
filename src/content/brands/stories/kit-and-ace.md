# Kit and Ace

Kit and Ace is a Vancouver-based clothing brand founded in 2014 by Shannon Wilson and her son JJ Wilson — Shannon being the wife of Lululemon founder Chip Wilson. The brand was created to fill a gap between athletic wear and office wear, producing what it calls "technical casuals" — clothing made with high-performance fabrics and construction techniques but designed for everyday life rather than the gym. The idea was that the comfort and performance of activewear shouldn't stop when you leave the studio.

## Technical Casuals

Kit and Ace's signature innovation is its proprietary machine-washable technical cashmere fabric, which combines the softness and luxury feel of cashmere with the durability, wrinkle resistance, and easy-care properties of technical fabrics. The product line includes pants, shirts, dresses, sweaters, and outerwear for both men and women, all designed to look polished enough for a meeting but feel comfortable enough for a cross-country flight. The fabrics resist wrinkles, stretch with movement, and hold their shape through repeated washing.

## Design Philosophy

The brand's aesthetic is clean, minimal, and urban — the kind of clothing that looks intentional without being fussy. Colours tend toward a sophisticated neutral palette with seasonal accents, and cuts are modern and tailored without being restrictive. Kit and Ace designs for the way people actually live in cities: commuting, working, meeting friends, and moving through their day without wanting to change clothes three times.

## Vancouver Roots

Kit and Ace operates through its online store and select retail locations, with its headquarters in Vancouver. The brand has carved out a distinct niche in the Canadian fashion landscape, offering an alternative to both stiff traditional business wear and the ultra-casual athleisure that dominates. For Canadians who want clothes that perform technically but present professionally, Kit and Ace delivers on the promise that comfort and style don't have to be separate wardrobes.
