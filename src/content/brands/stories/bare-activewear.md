# Bare Activewear

Bare Activewear is a Canadian women's activewear brand designed in Calgary, Alberta, for the realities of Canadian women's lives — not just the gym, but the school run, the coffee shop, the errands, and everything in between. The brand creates bras, leggings, joggers, and athleisure pieces that blend athletic performance with everyday wearability. The philosophy is that activewear should transition seamlessly from a workout to the rest of your day without needing a complete outfit change.

## The Collection

Bare's product line covers the essentials of a functional activewear wardrobe. Leggings come in high-waisted designs with compression levels suited to both intense training and all-day comfort. Sports bras offer real support across a range of sizes, with designs that look good enough to wear as standalone tops. Joggers and loungewear pieces bridge the gap between athletic and casual. The fabrics are chosen for four-way stretch, moisture-wicking, and durability — technical enough for serious workouts but soft and comfortable enough for couch time.

## Designed for Real Life

What sets Bare apart from many activewear brands is the emphasis on real-life wearability rather than Instagram aesthetics. The designs account for the fact that most women don't spend their entire day in a gym — they need activewear that looks appropriate at a parent-teacher meeting, doesn't require constant adjustment during a spin class, and survives the washing machine without pilling or losing shape. Sizing is inclusive, and the brand actively seeks feedback from customers to improve fit and function.

## Calgary Designed, Canadian Shipped

Bare Activewear is designed in Calgary and ships across Canada through its online store. The brand has built its customer base through social media and word of mouth, connecting with Canadian women who want quality activewear without the premium pricing of brands like Lululemon. For women who live in their activewear — and in Canada's casual, outdoor-oriented culture, many do — Bare offers pieces that earn their place in heavy rotation.
