# Giant Tiger

Gordon Reid opened the first Giant Tiger store in Ottawa's Byward Market in 1961 with a simple pitch: brand-name products at the lowest possible prices. Over six decades later, that pitch has not changed much, but the company has grown to more than 260 stores across Canada, all still headquartered in Ottawa.

## The Canadian Discount Original

Giant Tiger predates Walmart's Canadian entry by over 30 years and has carved out a loyal customer base by serving small towns and suburban communities that larger retailers often overlook. While Walmart and Costco tend to anchor large retail power centres, Giant Tiger thrives in smaller-format locations, often in strip malls and neighbourhood plazas. The stores stock a mix of groceries, clothing, household goods, toys, and seasonal items, all priced aggressively. The company's private-label brands, including its clothing lines, offer quality that regularly surprises shoppers expecting bare-bones discount fare.

## Independently Owned, Locally Operated

A key part of the Giant Tiger model is that most stores are independently owned and operated by local franchisees. This gives individual locations a community connection that big-box competitors struggle to replicate. Store owners often sponsor local sports teams, food drives, and charity events. The company provides centralized buying power and distribution while letting owners adapt their stores to local tastes and needs.

## Staying Private and Staying Canadian

Giant Tiger has resisted the temptation to go public or sell to international buyers. The Reid family maintained control for decades, and the company's leadership has kept the focus squarely on Canadian markets. While competitors have come and gone — Zellers, Target Canada — Giant Tiger has quietly expanded its footprint. The company has also invested in e-commerce through gianttiger.com, offering online shopping with delivery and in-store pickup options, though the physical store experience remains the core of the business.
