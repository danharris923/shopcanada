# Earls

Earls began in 1982 when Leroy "Bus" Fuller and his son Stanley opened the first location in Edmonton, Alberta. Bus Fuller had previously founded Fuller's Restaurant chain, and the new concept was designed to be a step up from casual dining without the formality of fine dining. That formula clicked, and Earls now operates roughly 70 locations across Canada and a handful in the United States.

## The Upscale Casual Pioneer

Before Earls, the Canadian dining scene had a gap between fast-casual chains and white-tablecloth restaurants. Earls helped invent the category now known as "upscale casual," where the food is ambitious but the dress code is relaxed and the atmosphere is social. The menu pulls from global cuisines, featuring everything from sushi and Thai-inspired dishes to steaks and pasta, all prepared in scratch kitchens rather than reheated from frozen. Executive chefs oversee menu development centrally, but individual locations have some freedom to incorporate local ingredients.

## A Family Business, Still

Unlike many restaurant chains of its size, Earls remains privately held by the Fuller family, with Stanley Fuller continuing to guide the company's direction. Headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the company also operates several of its highest-profile locations. The decision to stay private has allowed Earls to invest in restaurant design and food quality without the quarterly earnings pressure that shapes publicly traded competitors.

## Expansion and Evolution

Earls has been deliberate about growth, preferring to open in high-visibility locations with strong design rather than expanding rapidly into every available market. The restaurants are known for their interiors, which tend to feature open kitchens, patios, and contemporary decor that gets refreshed regularly. Each new location typically involves a multimillion-dollar buildout, reinforcing the brand's position in the premium segment of the casual dining market.
