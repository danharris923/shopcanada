# Instameals

Instameals is a Toronto-based prepared meal delivery service that ships chef-made, ready-to-eat meals requiring no cooking. Operating under the full name Instameals Ready Foods, Ltd., the company delivers thousands of meals to families across Ontario and Montreal every week. Meals are developed by an in-house dietitian and culinary team, arriving fresh — never frozen — and ready to heat in three minutes or less via microwave, oven, or stovetop in BPA-free, microwave-safe containers.

## The Menu

Instameals offers approximately 35 weekly meal options plus over 60 add-ons including snacks, smoothies, and desserts. The menu changes every week, rotating globally-inspired recipes alongside bestselling classics and seasonal creations. Pricing starts at $12 per meal with plans from $60 per week, positioning the service as one of Canada's most affordable ready-to-eat meal options. Free delivery kicks in on orders over $80, and a subscription model lets customers skip, pause, or cancel anytime before the weekly cutoff.

## Delivery Across Ontario and Montreal

Instameals delivers twice weekly across the Greater Toronto Area, Ottawa, Hamilton, and several other Ontario regions, as well as Montreal. The service fills a specific niche in the Canadian meal delivery market — these are not meal kits that require cooking, but fully prepared dishes ready to eat with minimal reheating. All product listings include detailed ingredient information with common allergens specifically called out, making the service accessible to customers managing dietary restrictions.

## No-Cook Convenience

For Canadians who want home-delivered meals without the prep work of traditional meal kits, Instameals offers a straightforward subscription service. The rotating weekly menu keeps things interesting, the fresh-not-frozen approach maintains quality, and the price point makes it a practical everyday option rather than a special occasion splurge. The service continues to expand its delivery footprint across Ontario and Quebec.
