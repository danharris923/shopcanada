# FreshCo

FreshCo is a Canadian discount grocery chain operated by Sobeys Inc., a subsidiary of Empire Company Limited. Launched in 2010, FreshCo was created to compete directly with discount grocery leaders like No Frills and Food Basics by offering low prices in a clean, modern store format. The banner replaced the aging Price Chopper stores and brought a fresh approach to discount grocery — proving that affordable groceries don't have to mean a bare-bones, warehouse-style shopping experience.

## Discount Done Differently

FreshCo differentiates itself from other discount grocers through its store design and fresh food emphasis. While the pricing is firmly in the discount category, the stores are brighter, more organized, and more pleasant to shop in than the no-frills environments typically associated with budget grocery. The fresh departments — produce, bakery, deli, and meat — receive more attention than at many discount competitors, and the stores stock a broader range of ethnic and specialty foods reflecting Canada's diverse communities.

## Serving Diverse Communities

FreshCo has been particularly successful in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, stocking products that reflect the cooking traditions of the communities each store serves. Locations in areas with large South Asian, Chinese, Filipino, or Middle Eastern populations carry specialty ingredients, fresh produce, and pantry items tailored to those cuisines. This culturally responsive approach to inventory has helped FreshCo build loyalty in communities that feel underserved by generic grocery selections.

## Growing Across Canada

FreshCo operates stores across Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, and continues to expand. The banner has proven that there's a market for discount grocery that respects its customers — offering low prices without sacrificing the shopping experience. For budget-conscious Canadian families who want affordable groceries in a pleasant store environment with a diverse product selection, FreshCo delivers value without compromise.
