# Jack59

Jack59 is a B Corp-certified Canadian haircare brand founded in 2015 by Vanessa Marshall, an Indigenous Metis entrepreneur from the Metis Nation of Alberta. A former dental assistant with a chemistry background, Marshall left her career to build a sustainable beauty company from Edmonton. The name Jack59 comes from her daughter Isabella, who at age four named a stray dog that wandered into their yard "Jack59" — a name that stuck and eventually became the company. Today Jack59 shampoo and conditioner bars are available at 288 retail locations across Canada including London Drugs, Whole Foods, Co-op, and Pharmasave.

## Plastic-Free Haircare

Jack59's core products are pH-balanced shampoo and conditioner bars handmade in small batches in Edmonton. The range includes formulas for every hair type — Amplify for volume, Vitality for oily hair, Serenity for sensitive scalps, Citrus Shine for curly hair, Blonde Bombshell for colour-treated hair, and Dreams for children. Each shampoo bar replaces up to three plastic bottles, and conditioner bars replace up to five, contributing to the company's elimination of over 500,000 plastic bottles from the waste stream. All products are naturally paraben-free, sulfate-free, phthalate-free, silicone-free, vegan, and cruelty-free, packaged in 100% compostable containers.

## Indigenous Entrepreneurship

Marshall's work has been recognized with the Alberta Women Entrepreneurs Indigenous Entrepreneur Award, the EDC Export Award, the Amy Willier Award for Indigenous Artisans, and the CANIE Indigenous Entrepreneur of the Year in 2023. Jack59 is Certified Indigenous Business and Leaping Bunny approved. The company is women-led, primarily hires local women, and offers flexible hours to support employees with caregiving responsibilities.

## Growing Across Canada

Jack59 ships globally and is available in boutiques and retail locations across Canada and the United States. For Canadians looking for salon-quality haircare that eliminates plastic waste, Jack59 delivers effective, sustainable products from an Indigenous-owned Edmonton company.
