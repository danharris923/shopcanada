# Dennys

Canadians have enjoyed classic favourites like the Grand Slam and the Savoury Omelette in Denny’s Canada family restaurants for over 55 years. As a 100% Canadian-owned and operated company, our roots are in the Great White North.

We hire Canadians, buy from Canadian companies, and are owned and operated by Canadians. We’re known as Canada’s Diner for our friendly reputation for guest satisfaction. Guests always expect our diverse menu of high-quality food at a great price.

Denny’s Canada is a Canadian franchise solely acquired by Northland Properties, Canada’s fastest-growing hospitality group. This trusted hospitality brand also owns Chop Steakhouse & Bar, Grouse Mountain Resort, Moxies, Revelstoke Mountain Resort, Sandman Hotel Group, and The Sutton Place Hotels.

As a 100% Canadian and family-owned company, Northland Properties’ profits and local investments stay in our communities, strengthening families and economies. The foundation of our continued success is our people, and taking care of our guests and the community.
