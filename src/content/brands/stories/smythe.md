# Smythe

Smythe is a Canadian luxury fashion brand founded in 2004 by Andrea Lenczner and Christie Smythe in Toronto. The brand is best known for its expertly tailored blazers, which have become a signature piece worn by style editors, celebrities, and women who understand the power of a perfectly cut jacket. Every Smythe blazer is designed in Canada and manufactured in the brand's own Toronto factory, maintaining complete control over the quality and fit that defines the label.

## The Blazer Authority

Smythe built its reputation on one garment: the blazer. While the brand has expanded into coats, dresses, and other pieces, the blazer remains the centrepiece of every collection. Smythe blazers are known for their sharp tailoring, feminine silhouettes, and distinctive details — a nipped waist here, an unexpected lining there, a perfect roll of the sleeve. The designs manage to feel both structured and effortless, making them equally appropriate for a boardroom, a dinner party, or thrown over jeans on a Saturday afternoon.

## Made in Toronto

In an era when most fashion brands have moved production overseas, Smythe maintains its own manufacturing facility in Toronto. The decision to produce domestically isn't just about branding — it's about quality control, turnaround time, and the ability to oversee every stitch. The Toronto factory employs skilled seamstresses and tailors, and the proximity to the design studio means samples and adjustments can happen in real time. This commitment to Canadian manufacturing is central to the brand's identity and its price point.

## Canadian Luxury, Global Reach

Smythe is carried at high-end retailers including Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Holt Renfrew, as well as through its own online store. The brand has dressed notable figures across entertainment, politics, and media, and has been featured in Vogue, Elle, and Harper's Bazaar. For Canadian women looking for investment pieces with impeccable tailoring and genuine made-in-Canada quality, Smythe represents the pinnacle of Canadian fashion design.
