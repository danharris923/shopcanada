# Rhino Coffee House

Rhino Coffee House is a Canadian specialty coffee roaster that sources, roasts, and sells premium coffee beans with a focus on freshness and flavour transparency. The brand takes a craft approach to coffee roasting, developing roast profiles that highlight the unique characteristics of each origin rather than applying a one-size-fits-all dark roast that masks the bean's natural flavours. The result is coffee that reflects the terroir, processing method, and variety of each lot.

## The Roasting Approach

Rhino roasts in small batches, allowing precise control over temperature, timing, and airflow to develop each bean's optimal flavour profile. Single-origin offerings let customers explore coffees from specific regions and farms, while house blends are crafted to deliver consistent, balanced cups suitable for daily drinking. The brand offers a range of roast levels from light to dark, with detailed tasting notes for each coffee — helping customers understand what they're drinking and develop their palate over time.

## Bean Selection

The green coffee beans are sourced through specialty importers who work directly with farmers and cooperatives in coffee-growing regions around the world. Rhino selects beans based on cup quality, paying attention to factors like altitude, processing method, and variety. This careful selection process means every coffee in the lineup meets specialty-grade standards — a measurable quality threshold that separates premium coffee from the commodity-grade beans that large commercial roasters use.

## Fresh to Your Cup

Rhino Coffee House sells through its online store, shipping freshly roasted beans across Canada. The brand includes roast dates on every bag, encouraging customers to brew within the optimal freshness window. For Canadian coffee enthusiasts who want to explore single origins, try new roast profiles, and drink better coffee at home, Rhino offers a straightforward way to access specialty-grade beans from a Canadian roaster who takes the craft seriously.
