# Hardbite Chips

OUR STORY KEEPING IT REAL SINCE 1998 Traditional Crafting We started out in British Columbia, handcrafting all-natural chips that could stand toe-to-toe with the big brands without any artificial flavours or preservatives.

We carefully crafted every chip with just enough frying to create a satisfying crunch, going the extra mile to perfect the taste and flavour profiles. Staying Inspired At every stage, our goal was to create the best natural chip we possibly could – some might say we were irritatingly picky – but we stayed focused on all-natural ingredients, being non-GMO before it was a thing, and creating a snack that would naturally resonate with those inspired by nature and adventure.

We keep growing Our company has grown, and so have our product lines. We’ve added chips made from root vegetables and chips cooked in avocado oil, but our passion for quality hasn’t wavered. Neither has our quest to explore the most interesting flavour combinations, encouraging people to step outside their comfort zone.

We’ll never stop exploring and pushing the boundaries of what a natural snack can be. TAKE A BITE OUTTA LIFE We believe the best moments in life come with a side of snacks. Whether you’re trekking a trail with a buddy, cracking up with a co-worker, or enjoying a movie night with the fam, Hardbite wants you to take a bite outta life, one crunchy, all-natural chip at a time.

WE LET OUR CHIPS DO THE TALKING Sure, we talk a big game, but we let our chips do the real heavy lifting. Experience the Hardbite difference and you’ll see that better-for-you snacks don’t have to taste like it.

REAL INGREDIENTS. REALLY GOOD TIMES. We believe in keeping it real with our ingredients and our customers. We don’t put anything into our chips that we wouldn’t be happy to eat ourselves (and we’re pretty picky).
