# Matt Nat

Our Story Our Story Passionate and in awe of the world around us, the idea for MAT(T)ERIAL and NATURE came to life in 1995, in the vibrant city of Montreal. At MATT & NAT, we live by the motto, “live beautifully”. This means we appreciate and cherish the creativity and positivity found in all of us. We value social responsibility, excellence, inclusiveness, integrity, authenticity and of course love. We have and will forever be committed to not using leather or any other animal based materials in our designs. Each season, we continue to explore and utilize innovative ways to improve our sustainable and eco-friendly ways, while still producing high-quality and timeless products. Over the years, we have been experimenting with different recycled materials such as nylons, cardboard, rubber, cork and now windshield resins. Since 2007, we have been committed to using linings made solely of 100% recycled plastic bottles. Today, we are proud to announce that we recycle over 9 million plastic bottles annually in the manufacturing of our bags. MATT & NAT collections can now be found in over 800 boutiques across Canada, the United States, the UK, Japan, Germany and Australia.
