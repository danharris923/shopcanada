# Chocolats Favoris

Chocolats Favoris is a Quebec-based chocolate company best known for its signature chocolate-dipped soft serve ice cream and its proprietary caramel milk chocolate — a closely guarded recipe that combines the flavours of roasted caramel and dulce de leche with a velvety chocolate texture. Founded in Quebec City, the brand has grown from a single chocolate shop into one of Quebec's most beloved dessert brands, with locations across the province and a growing presence beyond.

## The Chocolate Dip

Chocolats Favoris' signature experience is its soft serve ice cream dipped in a shell of premium chocolate that hardens on contact — creating a satisfying crack with every bite. The chocolate coatings are made in-house from high-quality chocolate and come in flavours including milk, dark, caramel, white, and seasonal specialties. The experience of watching your cone get dipped and choosing from a wall of chocolate options has become a ritual for Quebec families, especially in summer.

## Chocolate Products

Beyond the ice cream experience, Chocolats Favoris produces a range of chocolate products for home enjoyment. The fondue chocolate line brings the dipping experience home, and the brand's chocolate bars, spreads, and gift boxes feature the same premium chocolate used in the shops. The caramel milk chocolate — the brand's signature flavour — is available across the product line and has developed a cult following among chocolate lovers who find it genuinely unlike anything else on the market.

## A Quebec Treasure

Chocolats Favoris operates chocolate shops across Quebec and sells its packaged products online and at select retailers. The brand has become a symbol of Quebec's artisanal food culture, offering a chocolate experience that's playful, indulgent, and rooted in genuine craftsmanship. For Canadians with a sweet tooth and an appreciation for quality chocolate, Chocolats Favoris delivers an experience that transcends ordinary dessert.
