# Kokom Scrunchies

Kokom Scrunchies is a family-run, Indigenous-owned Canadian business that launched in 2019 with a simple product and a meaningful mission: handmade scrunchies crafted from fabrics that celebrate Indigenous culture, heritage, and identity. The word "Kokom" means "grandmother" in Cree, honouring the matriarchs and knowledge keepers whose traditions inspire the brand. Each scrunchie is lovingly handmade in Canada by the family, turning a basic hair accessory into a small but powerful statement of cultural pride.

## The Fabrics and Designs

Kokom Scrunchies are made from a range of fabrics including ribbon prints, floral patterns, and designs that draw on Indigenous artistic traditions. The scrunchies feature colours and motifs that resonate with Indigenous communities — ribbon skirt-inspired patterns, beadwork aesthetics, and woodland floral designs. Beyond standard scrunchies, the product line has expanded to include matching accessories, headbands, and seasonal collections. Each piece is handmade with care, meaning slight variations between items add character and authenticity.

## Cultural Celebration

What sets Kokom Scrunchies apart from generic hair accessories is the cultural significance woven into every product. The brand uses its platform to celebrate Indigenous identity and educate customers about the cultural context behind the designs. Wearing a Kokom Scrunchie is, for many Indigenous customers, a way to express cultural pride in their everyday life. For non-Indigenous customers, purchasing from Kokom is a way to support Indigenous-owned business and appreciate Indigenous artistry.

## Growing from a Simple Idea

What started as a small idea has grown into a recognized brand within Indigenous and Canadian markets. Kokom Scrunchies sells through its online store and at Indigenous markets, powwows, and cultural events across Canada. The brand has been featured in media coverage of Indigenous entrepreneurship and has built a strong social media following. The family continues to handmake each scrunchie, maintaining the personal touch and quality that has defined the brand from its beginnings.
