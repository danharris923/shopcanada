# Crate & Barrel

Crate & Barrel is an American home furnishings retailer founded in 1962 by Gordon and Carole Segal in Chicago, Illinois. The couple opened their first store in an old elevator factory on Wells Street, displaying European housewares and furniture on the crates and barrels they'd been shipped in — hence the name. The brand has since grown into one of North America's premier home furnishing retailers, known for modern, well-designed furniture, kitchenware, and decor that balances contemporary style with everyday functionality.

## Modern Home Design

Crate & Barrel's product range covers furniture for every room, bedding and textiles, kitchen and dining essentials, lighting, rugs, and decorative accessories. The design sensibility is clean and contemporary without being cold — pieces that feel fresh and modern but still warm and livable. The brand is particularly strong in dining and kitchen, where its combination of everyday essentials and entertaining pieces has made it a go-to for wedding registries and new home outfitting. Quality sits in the mid-to-upper range, with furniture built to last years rather than seasons.

## Registry Staple

Crate & Barrel has been one of the most popular wedding and gift registry destinations in North America for decades. The brand's broad selection of kitchen, dining, bedding, and home accessories at various price points makes it ideal for registry shoppers. The registry service is well-organized and the brand's gift-giving credentials are strong — a Crate & Barrel box carries a certain expectation of quality and taste that makes it a reliable choice for milestones and celebrations.

## Crate & Barrel in Canada

Crate & Barrel operates a Canadian website at crateandbarrel.ca with local shipping and CAD pricing, along with retail locations in major Canadian cities. The brand also operates CB2, its younger, more urban-focused sibling. For Canadians furnishing a home with modern, quality pieces that will last, Crate & Barrel remains one of the most reliable names in home design retail.
