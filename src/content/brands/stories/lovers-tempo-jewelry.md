# Lover's Tempo

Lover's Tempo is a Vancouver-based jewellery brand that designs accessible, fashion-forward pieces meant to make everyday outfits feel polished and intentional. The brand grew from a market booth into a full design studio, with the team expanding to include co-founder Leslie and a creative group of women who bring each collection to life. From their Vancouver studio, Lover's Tempo creates jewellery that bridges the gap between costume jewellery and fine jewellery — well-made, beautifully designed pieces at prices that don't require a special occasion to justify.

## Everyday Elegance

The Lover's Tempo collection includes earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and hair accessories in styles that range from minimalist everyday pieces to bold statement designs. Materials include gold-plated and silver-plated metals, Swarovski crystals, freshwater pearls, and semi-precious stones. The designs are trend-aware without being trend-dependent — each season's collection introduces new styles while maintaining the brand's signature balance of femininity, lightness, and modern sophistication. Pieces are designed to layer and stack, encouraging customers to build personalized combinations.

## Designed in Vancouver

All Lover's Tempo jewellery is designed in the brand's Vancouver studio by an all-women team. The design process prioritizes wearability — pieces are lightweight, secure, and comfortable enough for all-day wear. The brand pays close attention to hardware quality, clasp security, and plating durability, addressing the common frustrations of affordable jewellery that tarnishes, breaks, or turns skin green. The result is fashion jewellery that performs above its price point.

## Accessible Canadian Style

Lover's Tempo sells through its online store and at over 500 retailers across Canada and internationally. The brand has become a favourite for gifting, with its combination of attractive packaging, thoughtful design, and accessible pricing making it easy to give jewellery that feels special without being extravagant. For Canadian women who want their accessories to elevate their daily style without breaking the bank, Lover's Tempo delivers polished design at every price point.
