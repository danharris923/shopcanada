# Satya Organic

Our Story "It all started with a need. My baby girl, Esme, was scratching her arms and legs bloody. The doctor diagnosed her with eczema and prescribed a topical steroid. I knew there had to be a better solution.

" WHY DID I START SATYA ORGANIC? Satya was first started out of my small, $15 crockpot — not because I had big business dreams or a desire to be an entrepreneur, but because of a real need. My baby girl, Esme, was scratching her arms and legs bloody.

The doctor diagnosed her with eczema and prescribed a topical steroid. Overwhelmed by the scientific-based evidence of the side effects of steroid creams, I knew there had to be a better solution. I wanted something effective, non-toxic, and fragrance-free, backed by scientifically supported research.

But to my disappointment, I couldn't find a single product that could safely heal her skin. Seeing my daughter in pain was the absolute worst feeling in the world. I decided to take matters into my own hands.

For nights, I used my investigative skills as a journalist and dug into traditional medicine, medical research, and the latest academic studies coming out of universities, desperate to find a solution.

I began experimenting in my kitchen with nothing more than a crockpot and the best organic ingredients I could find. Voila! There it was. I created a balm that would clear Esme's eczema up within two days.

JUST LIKE THAT, MY SECOND BABY, SATYA ORGANIC, WAS BORN! I never intended to become a business owner, but after having so many moms drive hours to try my formula, I knew this was my way of creating change.

As a mom, I knew that I couldn't be the only one struggling to find clean and effective skincare for my family that actually does what it says it does. I want every parent, partner, or friend to be able to access safe skin relief for their loved ones.

I want every eczema warrior in the world to get back to doing what they love most without the feeling of discomfort in their skin, or the painful, long-term effects...
