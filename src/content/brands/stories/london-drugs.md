# London Drugs

Sam Bass opened the first London Drugs in 1945 on Main Street in Vancouver, naming it after London, Ontario, where he had previously worked in pharmacy. What started as a single drugstore has grown into one of Western Canada's most distinctive retailers, with over 80 stores across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The company remains privately held and headquartered in Richmond, B.C.

## Not Your Average Pharmacy

Walk into a London Drugs and you will find something that does not exist anywhere else in Canadian retail: a store that sells prescription medications alongside professional cameras, computers, kitchen appliances, cosmetics, and seasonal patio furniture. The product mix is deliberately eclectic, combining a full-service pharmacy with electronics, home office supplies, and household goods. This unique format has made London Drugs a destination rather than a convenience stop, and it explains why the stores are significantly larger than a typical Shoppers Drug Mart or Rexall.

## Photo and Electronics Heritage

London Drugs built a strong reputation as a photography and electronics retailer long before big-box stores moved into that space. The company's photo labs and camera departments were the go-to resource for amateur and professional photographers across Western Canada. Even as the photography industry went digital, London Drugs adapted, offering printing services, photo books, and a curated selection of cameras and accessories. The electronics departments carry computers, tablets, TVs, and peripherals, staffed by employees who tend to have genuine product knowledge.

## Stubbornly Western Canadian

London Drugs has never expanded east of Manitoba, a deliberate choice that sets it apart from most Canadian retail chains. This regional focus allows the company to tailor its stores and inventory to Western Canadian preferences. The company is known for competitive pricing, frequently matching or beating big-box competitors on electronics and household goods. London Drugs also operates a robust online store at londondrugs.com with shipping across Canada, though the in-store experience remains the brand's greatest strength.
