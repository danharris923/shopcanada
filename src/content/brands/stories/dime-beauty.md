# Dime Beauty

Dime Beauty is an American clean skincare brand founded with the mission of making luxury-quality skincare accessible at prices that don't require a second mortgage. The brand has gained a massive following for its highly effective serums, moisturizers, and treatments that use premium, clean ingredients while keeping price points at a fraction of what comparable luxury brands charge. Dime proves that effective skincare doesn't have to cost $200 a bottle.

## Clean, Effective Skincare

Dime Beauty's product line includes serums, eye creams, cleansers, moisturizers, and targeted treatments formulated without parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or other ingredients commonly flagged in the clean beauty movement. The brand's hero products include its retinol alternative serum (using bakuchiol, a plant-based retinol that delivers similar results without the irritation), hyaluronic acid serums, and vitamin C treatments. Formulations are developed to deliver visible results — brighter skin, reduced fine lines, improved texture — using ingredients with genuine clinical evidence behind them.

## Luxury Results, Honest Pricing

What distinguishes Dime from the crowded clean beauty market is the combination of genuinely effective formulations with transparent, accessible pricing. Most products fall in the $20 to $40 range, a stark contrast to luxury skincare brands using similar ingredients at five to ten times the price. The brand is transparent about why: by selling direct to consumer and avoiding the markups that come with department store distribution, Dime passes the savings to customers without cutting corners on ingredients.

## Dime Beauty for Canadians

Dime Beauty ships to Canada through its online store, bringing its clean, affordable skincare to Canadian consumers. The brand has built a devoted following through social media, where before-and-after results and real customer testimonials drive organic growth. For Canadians who want clean, high-performance skincare without the luxury price tag, Dime Beauty delivers results that punch well above its price point.
