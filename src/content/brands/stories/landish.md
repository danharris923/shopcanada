# Landish

Landish is a Canadian functional food brand based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that creates superfood-enhanced snacks and pantry staples designed to make healthy eating effortless. The brand takes nutrient-dense ingredients like mushroom extracts, plant proteins, and adaptogens and works them into foods people actually want to eat — nut butters, granola, snack bars, and cooking ingredients that deliver functional health benefits without tasting like supplements.

## Functional Foods

The Landish product line includes mushroom-enhanced nut butters (featuring reishi, lion's mane, and chaga), protein-packed granola, superfood trail mixes, and cooking ingredients like mushroom broths and seasoning blends. The formulations combine familiar, enjoyable foods with functional ingredients that support energy, immunity, and cognitive function. The approach is pragmatic: rather than asking people to take pills or choke down powders, Landish embeds the good stuff into foods that are already part of daily routines.

## Honest Ingredients

Every Landish product is made with a short, readable ingredient list. The brand uses whole-food ingredients, avoids artificial preservatives and flavours, and is transparent about the sources and quantities of its functional additions. Products are made in Canada and cater to a range of dietary needs — many items are vegan, gluten-free, and free from common allergens. The mushroom extracts used are dual-extracted for maximum bioavailability, not just ground-up mushroom powder.

## Growing Across Canada

Landish sells through its online store, Amazon Canada, and a growing network of health food retailers and grocery stores across the country. The brand has carved out a niche among Canadians who are curious about functional foods and adaptogens but want to incorporate them naturally into their diets rather than through capsules and tinctures. For anyone who wants their afternoon snack to do more than just taste good, Landish makes the functional food category approachable and genuinely enjoyable.
