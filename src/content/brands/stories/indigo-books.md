# Indigo Books

Indigo Books refers to the bookselling arm of Indigo, Canada's largest bookstore chain. Operating under the Indigo, Chapters, and Coles banners across more than 160 locations nationwide, the company has been the dominant force in Canadian bookselling since founder Heather Reisman merged Indigo with Chapters in 2001. The bookstore side of the business remains the heart of the brand, with one of the country's most comprehensive selections of fiction, non-fiction, children's books, and specialty titles.

## Canada's Bookstore

Indigo Books carries an extensive selection spanning every genre and format: hardcovers, paperbacks, audiobooks, e-books through the Kobo platform, and a deep selection of magazines and journals. The company's editorial team curates staff picks, reading lists, and seasonal recommendations that help readers discover new titles. The Heather's Picks program highlights the founder's personal book recommendations, creating a book-club-style connection between the brand and its customers.

## Online and In-Store

The indigo.ca e-commerce platform offers the full book catalogue with Canadian shipping, while the physical stores provide the browsing experience that book lovers value — the ability to pick up a book, read a few pages, and discover titles through serendipity rather than algorithms. Many locations include cafes and reading areas that encourage customers to settle in and spend time with books before buying.

## Supporting Canadian Literature

Indigo has played a significant role in promoting Canadian authors and publishers, using its retail platform and marketing reach to give Canadian titles prominent placement. For Canadian readers who want access to a wide selection of books — from international bestsellers to Canadian literary fiction to niche interest titles — Indigo Books remains the country's most comprehensive bookselling destination, both online and in communities across the country.
