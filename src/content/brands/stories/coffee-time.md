# Coffee Time

Coffee Time is a Canadian coffee and doughnut chain founded in 1982 in Bolton, Ontario, by Tom Guistra. The chain grew rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s, primarily in Ontario, becoming a fixture in small towns and suburban neighbourhoods as an affordable alternative to Tim Hortons. At its peak, Coffee Time operated over 200 locations across Ontario and internationally, serving the familiar Canadian combination of coffee, doughnuts, baked goods, and basic lunch fare.

## The Canadian Coffee Shop

Coffee Time locations serve a straightforward menu of drip coffee, specialty coffee drinks, doughnuts, muffins, bagels, soups, and sandwiches. The positioning has always been budget-friendly and neighbourhood-oriented — the kind of place where regulars come for their morning coffee, construction crews grab lunch, and families stop for doughnuts on a Saturday morning. The no-frills approach keeps prices low and the atmosphere casual, serving communities that value convenience and value over trendy coffeehouse aesthetics.

## Community Presence

Coffee Time has built its brand on being present in the communities it serves, often in locations that larger chains overlook. Many franchises are family-operated businesses with deep roots in their neighbourhoods, and the chain's social responsibility commitments include community engagement and responsible sourcing practices. The brand strives to do the right thing for customers and the environment, working to improve how it sources products.

## A Canadian Chain

Coffee Time continues to operate locations across Ontario, serving the everyday coffee and baked goods needs of Canadian communities. While the chain operates in the shadow of larger Canadian coffee brands, it has maintained a loyal customer base among people who prefer its no-frills approach, neighbourhood presence, and affordable pricing. For Canadians looking for a quick, affordable coffee and a doughnut from a homegrown chain, Coffee Time remains a familiar and reliable option.
