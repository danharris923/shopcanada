# 19 99 Beauty

BEAUTY FOR EVERYONE, AGES 19 TO 99 Why does 19/99 exist? Because beauty isn’t defined by age—it’s defined by you. We believe in self-expression without limits, without labels, and without compromise. Whether you're 19 or 99, beauty is yours to define.

DO MORE WITH LESS Our approach is simple: do more with less. We create multi-functional, high-performance makeup essentials for building, blending, buffing, smudging, and doing what you want. Makeup is an embellishment, an accessory, and above all, temporary.

We embrace and find beauty in the smears, strokes, creases, and the time spent with ourselves to make up or just to touch up. Every product is cruelty-free, vegan, and free of synthetic fragrances. Sustainability matters to us, too.

That’s why we prioritize recycled and recyclable materials while minimizing plastic use. . WHO WE ARE 19/99 is female founded, female owned, and based in Toronto, Canada. We believe beauty isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s personal, ever-evolving, and limitless.

Partnering with industry visionaries Diti Katona and Simone Otis, we’re challenging outdated standards and reshaping the conversation around beauty and self-expression. This isn’t just makeup. It’s a movement.

And we’d love for you to be part of it.
