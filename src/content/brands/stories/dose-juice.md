# Dose Juice

Happy to serve your daily DOSE of wellness since 2013. Whether you choose a ginger shot filled with superfoods or super green juice, you're in good hands with our healthy products. Juggling with their busy schedule and their desire to consume more veggies, Gen & Raph first started juicing in their tiny Montreal Old-Port kitchen in 2013.

Nowadays, the couple along with a bunch of cool humans work hard to offer you bottles of wellness. Feminism, a core value 1 It's featured in the employee manual and we ask every member of our team to share this value 2 We make sure we have at least 50% of women among our employees, directors and business partners 3 Our job postings(in French) are written in the feminine "by default" to attract women to come work with us 4 We support many feminist organizations by sponsoring events, participating in their projects and more Our products are certified organic Producing healthy products means choosing healthy methods.

Here’s why we chose to create ORGANIC juices, shots, and smoothies. Wouldn’t it be counterproductive to offer you beverages that contain traces of pesticides and other chemicals like the ones used in traditional agriculture?

Shop Now Ecocert Canada USDA organic Certification Kosher Locally produce All our products are proudly juiced in our Canada-based factory We also choose to work with local producers for most of our ingredients(we're still waiting for Canadian pineapples though...

). Goodbye NEW plastic! Why not glass bottles? Did you know that glass bottles take 4,000 years or more before decomposing?!? So, reusing plastic again-and-again for single-use items such as juice bottle seems likethe best idea ever, no?

At DOSE, it’s a tremendous step forward to reduce our environmental footprint. From now on, all our bottles will be entirely made up of PCR plastic (Post Consumer Resin). By using this eco-friendly material, no more NEW plastic will be created to manufacture our bottles.

Cheers to greener green juices and a greener ...
