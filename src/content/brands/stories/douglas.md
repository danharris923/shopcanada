# Douglas

Our Story Douglas: the Mattress Made for Canadians Canada First In 2009, we launched what would become Canada’s largest independent online mattress company. GoodMorning.com is a company of firsts: the first 100+ night trial; the first online luxury mattress brand in North America; the first to offer 100% free returns; and the first to offer zip-in adjustable firmness. We’ve seen many competitors come and go, most of them designing their products for the USA and treating Canada as an afterthought. With Douglas, we decided to put our focus on Canadian sleepers first and foremost. Douglas has been designed, crafted, and tested for Canadians from the beginning. Based in Western Canada, our co-founder, Sam Prochazka, spent many months combining the best high-performance foams and textiles from Canada’s top manufacturers, and the results are breathtaking: we have created one of Canada’s best sleep products for a simply unbeatable price.
