# Tea Horse

About Us Tea as it should be authentic ingredients + Infused with passion OUR STORY Tea Horse, established in 2017 by Denise Atkinson, Anishinaabe ikwe (English: Ojibwe woman) and her partner Marc H. Bohémier, is an Indigenous-owned artisanal tea company located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg Peoples in Northwestern Ontario.

With its proprietary roasting process, Tea Horse has created and produces an industry-first selection of custom roasted wild rice (Ojibwe: manoomin) and tea blends. ManoominCha™ combines the sweet, grassy notes of green tea with the aroma and nutty characteristics of wild rice.

Lightly caffeinated. ManoominCha™ Dark: Hojicha, a roasted green tea and wild rice are blended to create a complex and full-bodied mocha-flavoured experience. Lightly caffeinated. Manoominaabo™ Tisane: Roasted wild rice creates a smooth and creamy toasted chestnut flavoured tisane.

100% caffeine-free. OUR MISSION To provide a unique selection of teas inspired by Indigenous traditions, infused with Canadian roasted wild rice, and to use every cup as a way to promote cultural connection, understanding, and engagement.

OUR VISION To contribute to a Canadian economy and cultural ecosystem where Indigenous women are empowered to envision limitless possibilities, challenge barriers, and thrive as leaders and entrepreneurs.

CORE VALUES We are committed to cultivating environments that promote inclusivity, build trust, and celebrate the power of Indigenous storytelling.
