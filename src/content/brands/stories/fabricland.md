# Fabricland

Fabricland is Canada's largest fashion fabric distributor, a proudly Canadian and independent family-run business that has been outfitting sewists, designers, and crafters since 1968. The first store opened at Queen and Roncesvalles in Toronto, carrying crimplene knits that were the height of fashion at the time. Over five decades later, Fabricland operates more than 100 stores coast to coast and employs over 2,000 people, offering everything a maker needs under one roof.

## From Crimplene to Couture

Fabricland grew steadily through the decades, establishing its head office in Toronto's Design District during the 1970s and expanding into provinces across Canada. The 1980s brought the iconic Fabricland jingle that became lodged in the memories of a generation of Canadian shoppers. In 1993, the chain introduced exclusive drapery departments called the Home Dec Centre, recognizing that its customers were creating far more than clothing. The company celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, a milestone few independent Canadian retailers reach.

## All Sewing Products Under One Roof

Fabricland stores stock thousands of bolts of fabric spanning every category — fashion fabrics, fleece, denim, knits, silk, linen, upholstery, outdoor, bridal, and seasonal specialties — alongside a comprehensive selection of sewing notions, patterns from major brands, sewing machines, quilting supplies, yarn, and craft materials. The chain's legendary sales events, often featuring dramatic percentage-off promotions, have made quality textiles accessible at every budget. The breadth of inventory is what sets Fabricland apart: a single visit can supply an entire project from fabric selection to finishing touches.

## Serving the Maker Movement

Fabricland's customer base has evolved alongside the resurgence of DIY culture, now serving small business owners, cosplayers, home décor designers, wardrobe production companies, and a new generation of sewers driven by sustainability and self-expression. In an era when fast fashion dominates and making things by hand carries new meaning, Fabricland continues to provide the raw materials that empower Canadians to create with their own hands.
