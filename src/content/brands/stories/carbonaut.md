# Carbonaut

Carbonaut launched in Canada with a mission to prove that low-carb bread doesn't have to taste like cardboard. Founded in the Toronto area, the company set out to create bread, bagels, tortillas, and buns that fit within ketogenic and low-carb diets while maintaining the soft, fresh-baked texture and flavour that people expect from real bakery products. The brand's tagline — "Low Carb. Big Taste." — captures the proposition: you shouldn't have to sacrifice enjoyment just because you're watching your carbohydrate intake.

## The Products

Carbonaut's core product line includes sliced bread (white, seeded, and specialty varieties), bagels, hot dog buns, hamburger buns, and tortillas, all engineered to contain significantly fewer net carbs than conventional equivalents. A typical Carbonaut bread slice contains around 1-2 grams of net carbs compared to 12-15 grams in standard bread. The products use a proprietary blend of plant-based fibres, wheat protein, and other ingredients to achieve the texture and rise that most low-carb breads fail to deliver. The brand also produces pizza crusts and flatbreads.

## Keto and Beyond

While Carbonaut initially targeted the keto community, the brand's appeal has expanded to include anyone looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake — whether for weight management, blood sugar control, or general health. The products are certified by recognized low-carb and keto certification bodies, giving consumers confidence in the nutritional claims. Carbonaut products are also a source of fibre, with many items containing 12-14 grams of fibre per serving, appealing to health-conscious consumers beyond the strict keto demographic.

## Available Across Canada

Carbonaut products are available at major Canadian grocery retailers including Loblaws, Sobeys, Metro, Walmart, and Costco, as well as through online grocery delivery platforms. The brand has also expanded into the United States market. In the growing low-carb and keto food category, Carbonaut has distinguished itself by competing not just on macros but on taste and texture — the factors that ultimately determine whether a health-focused product becomes a pantry staple or a one-time purchase.
