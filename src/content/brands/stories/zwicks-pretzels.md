# Zwicks Pretzels

Zwicks Pretzels is a Canadian snack brand that makes hand-twisted, small-batch pretzels using traditional baking methods. The company takes an artisanal approach to a snack that is typically mass-produced, starting with quality flour and real butter rather than the hydrogenated oils and preservatives found in most commercial pretzel brands. The pretzels are baked, not fried, and seasoned with creative flavour combinations that go beyond the standard salted pretzel.

## The Flavours

Zwicks' flavour lineup sets the brand apart from commodity pretzel producers. Beyond the classic salted variety, the range includes bold and creative options — everything from cinnamon sugar and honey mustard to more adventurous seasonings. Each flavour is developed in-house and applied to freshly baked pretzels, resulting in a more intensely flavoured product than the lightly dusted pretzels from big brands. The pretzels have a satisfying crunch and a buttery richness that reflects the use of real ingredients.

## Small Batch Quality

Every batch of Zwicks pretzels is made in small quantities to maintain quality and freshness. The hand-twisting process, while more labour-intensive than machine production, gives the pretzels their distinctive shape and texture. The small-batch approach means the brand can maintain tighter quality control and introduce new flavours more quickly than large-scale manufacturers. The ingredient lists are short and pronounceable — flour, butter, salt, and seasonings, without the chemical preservatives that extend shelf life at the expense of taste.

## Canadian Snacking

Zwicks Pretzels are available through the brand's online store and at select retailers across Canada. The pretzels have found a following among snack enthusiasts who appreciate artisanal quality and creative flavours, as well as among customers looking for better-ingredient alternatives to mainstream snack brands. The brand represents a growing movement in Canadian food — small producers who prove that even the most familiar snack categories have room for craft-quality products.
