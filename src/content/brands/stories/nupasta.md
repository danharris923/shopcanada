# nuPasta

nuPasta is a Canadian food brand that produces low-calorie, low-carb pasta made from konjac root, a plant native to Asia that has been used in Japanese cuisine for centuries. The company was founded in Toronto and launched its product into a market hungry for pasta alternatives that could satisfy cravings without the carbohydrate load of traditional wheat pasta. A standard serving of nuPasta contains approximately 25 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates, compared to roughly 200 calories and 40 grams of carbs in conventional pasta.

## The Konjac Difference

Konjac root (also known as glucomannan) is the key ingredient that makes nuPasta possible. The root produces a water-soluble fibre that can be formed into noodle shapes with a texture similar to traditional pasta. The resulting product is naturally gluten-free, vegan, and extremely low in calories and carbohydrates while being high in fibre. nuPasta comes in several varieties including spaghetti, fettuccine, penne, and angel hair, giving customers options that work with a range of sauces and recipes.

## For Keto, Low-Carb, and Beyond

While nuPasta initially gained traction in the keto and low-carb communities, its appeal has broadened to include anyone looking to reduce calorie intake, manage blood sugar levels, or simply eat lighter without giving up pasta-based meals. The product is particularly popular for meal prep, as it pairs well with protein-rich sauces and vegetables to create balanced, low-calorie meals. nuPasta is also shelf-stable and ready to eat after a simple rinse, eliminating the need to boil water — a convenience factor that adds to its appeal.

## Available Across Canada

nuPasta products are stocked at major Canadian grocery chains including Loblaws, Sobeys, Walmart, and Whole Foods, as well as health food stores and online retailers. The brand has also expanded into the United States market. In the growing category of pasta alternatives — which includes chickpea pasta, lentil pasta, and zucchini noodles — nuPasta distinguishes itself by offering the lowest calorie count and carb count while maintaining a noodle-like texture that the other alternatives don't quite replicate.
