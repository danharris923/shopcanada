# RONA

RONA traces its origins to 1939, when a group of independent hardware dealers in Quebec formed a purchasing cooperative called Quincaillerie Ro-Na to negotiate better prices from suppliers. The name combined the first syllables of two founding members' names: Rolland and Napoleon. What began as a buying group for small-town hardware stores evolved over the following decades into one of Canada's largest home improvement retailers, with the cooperative structure giving way to a publicly traded corporation by the 2000s.

## The Lowe's Chapter and Return

In 2016, American home improvement giant Lowe's acquired RONA for approximately $3.2 billion, gaining access to the Canadian market and RONA's extensive store network. The acquisition was controversial in Quebec, where RONA was seen as a homegrown success story. Under Lowe's ownership, many RONA locations were converted to the Lowe's banner, and the integration was rocky. In 2023, Sycamore Partners acquired the entire Canadian Lowe's/RONA operation, and the company subsequently announced plans to rebrand all Canadian stores under the RONA banner — a homecoming of sorts for the brand.

## Store Formats

RONA operates multiple store formats to serve different markets. RONA+ locations are large-format warehouse stores similar to Home Depot or the former Lowe's format, carrying a wide range of building materials, tools, appliances, plumbing, electrical, and seasonal products. Traditional RONA stores are smaller, often dealer-owned locations in smaller communities that provide personalized service and local expertise. The company also operates an affiliate network of independent hardware stores that carry RONA branding and benefit from centralized purchasing.

## Quebec Roots, National Presence

While RONA has stores across Canada, its roots remain firmly in Quebec, where the brand carries particular cultural significance. The company's headquarters are in Boucherville, Quebec, and a large portion of its stores are in the province. RONA serves both professional contractors and DIY homeowners, with contractor-focused programs, bulk pricing, and job site delivery available through its commercial division. The brand's return to Canadian ownership and the consolidation under the RONA name represents a new chapter for one of the country's most established home improvement retailers.
