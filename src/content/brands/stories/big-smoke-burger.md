# Big Smoke Burger

ABOUT US We’re here to serve up crave-worthy burgers that hit the spot every time. BORN & BRED IN TORONTO Big Smoke Burger was fired up in 2007 in the heart of Toronto- a city pulsing with culture, creativity, and culinary curiosity.

From street corners to skyline views, Toronto’s vibrant energy runs through every bite of our burgers. Sophisticated, bold, and bursting with flavour, Big Smoke is a true reflection of the 6ix: unapologetically diverse, proudly local, and irresistibly crave-worthy.

From day one, we’ve been a go-to for burger lovers who crave something real, something memorable – something truly Toronto. GRILLED TO ORDER. BURSTING WITH FLAVOUR. At Big Smoke Burger, freshness isn’t a feature – it’s a promise.

We use 100% Canadian ground chuck, custom-blended to deliver the perfect balance of tenderness, juiciness, and rich, beefy flavour. Each burger is made to order, flame-grilled to lock in smoky perfection, and served hot off the grill – because you deserve nothing less than burger bliss in every bite.

UNAPOLOGETICALLY GOURMET Our burgers are crafted with care and cooked with fire – slow-grilled for depth, served fast for the hustle, but never rushed in execution. We layer on premium toppings, stack bold flavours, and crown each creation with house-made sauces that hit different.

Our golden, fresh-cut fries are the ultimate sidekick, delivering that satisfying crunch that rounds out the experience. This is gourmet without the pretense – just next-level flavour, sizzling with attitude and pride.

Big Smoke Burger isn’t just a meal – it’s a love letter to Toronto’s fearless food scene. A bold, fire-kissed tribute to those who know that great taste starts with great ingredients and ends with an unforgettable bite.

From the 6ix to the world, we bring the heat, the flavour, and the soul of the city – one burger at a time.
