# Blush Lingerie

Blush Lingerie is a Canadian intimate apparel brand based in Montreal, Quebec — a city with a long history in the Canadian fashion and lingerie industry. The brand designs and produces bras, panties, sleepwear, and loungewear with an emphasis on playful design, comfortable fit, and inclusive sizing. Blush positions itself as an accessible alternative to luxury lingerie brands, offering stylish intimates at price points that don't require a special occasion to justify.

## The Design Philosophy

Blush Lingerie's collections balance femininity with fun, featuring prints, lace details, and colour palettes that range from classic neutrals to bold seasonal patterns. The brand's tagline encourages women to "embrace their unique sense of self with complete assurance and a flair for playfulness" — a philosophy that shows up in designs meant to make everyday underwear feel special rather than utilitarian. Collections are released seasonally, keeping the lineup fresh and on-trend while maintaining core basics that customers can rely on year-round.

## Sizing and Inclusivity

Blush has expanded its size range to serve a broader spectrum of body types, recognizing that the lingerie industry has historically underserved women outside a narrow size window. The brand offers extended sizes across its bra and panty collections, with a focus on ensuring that the same design aesthetics and quality construction are maintained across the full size range — not just in a token "plus" section with limited styles.

## Canadian Designed

Blush Lingerie is designed in Montreal and sold through its online store as well as through lingerie boutiques and department stores across Canada. The brand benefits from Montreal's deep expertise in the garment industry, particularly in intimate apparel, where the city has historically been a North American hub. For Canadian women looking for lingerie that's well-made, well-designed, and doesn't require importing from European or American brands, Blush offers a homegrown option that competes on both style and value.
