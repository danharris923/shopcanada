# Beaver Buzz

Beaver Buzz is a Canadian energy drink brand that launched as a proudly homegrown alternative to the Red Bulls and Monsters dominating convenience store coolers. The company was founded in Western Canada with the idea that Canadians deserved an energy drink made by Canadians, for Canadians — complete with an unabashedly Canadian beaver mascot on the can. The brand carved out a niche by offering a range of flavours and formulations that went beyond the standard energy drink taste profile.

## The Flavours

Beaver Buzz's lineup includes seven flavours that range from the Original citrus blend to more distinctive offerings like Saskatoon Berry (a nod to the prairie berry), Root Beer Energy, and Green Tea. The brand also offers zero-calorie options including Canadian Punch and Pineapple Mango. Each flavour contains the standard energy drink ingredients — caffeine, taurine, B vitamins, and ginseng — but the flavour development goes beyond the generic "energy" taste that characterizes most competitors. The Saskatoon Berry flavour in particular has become a fan favourite, offering a uniquely Canadian twist on the energy drink format.

## High Efficacy Formula

Beaver Buzz positions itself as a "high efficacy" energy drink, meaning the formulation is designed to deliver genuine energy rather than just a sugar rush. The drinks contain a blend of caffeine, ginseng, guarana, and B vitamins in amounts calibrated for sustained energy without the extreme crash. The zero-calorie versions use sucralose and acesulfame potassium instead of sugar, keeping the energy benefits while eliminating the caloric load.

## Canadian Pride

Beaver Buzz is available at convenience stores, gas stations, and grocery retailers across Canada. The brand has built a following by leaning into its Canadian identity — the beaver logo, the Canadian flavours, and the grassroots marketing approach that favours event sponsorships and social media over massive advertising budgets. In a category dominated by global corporations, Beaver Buzz represents a Canadian independent that competes on flavour and national pride.
