# Big Willy's Soap

Big Willy's Soap is a Canadian handmade soap and body care brand that brings personality and humour to a product category that often takes itself too seriously. The brand creates handcrafted bar soaps, bath products, and skincare items using natural, skin-friendly ingredients, but wraps them in packaging and branding that's playful, bold, and unapologetically fun. The name itself sets the tone — this is a brand that doesn't shy away from personality.

## Handmade Soap

Big Willy's bar soaps are handmade in Canada using traditional soap-making methods. The formulations use natural oils, butters, and botanical ingredients to create bars that cleanse effectively while moisturizing the skin. Scent profiles range from classic masculine options like cedar and sandalwood to creative combinations that reflect the brand's playful character. The bars are generously sized and designed to last, with a lather and feel that distinguishes them from commercial mass-produced soap.

## Beyond the Bar

The product line extends beyond bar soap to include bath bombs, body wash, scrubs, and other body care products. Each product carries the brand's signature combination of quality ingredients and irreverent branding. The products make popular gifts — particularly for people who are hard to shop for — thanks to the combination of genuinely useful, well-made products and packaging that brings a smile. Gift sets are a significant part of the business, especially around holidays.

## Canadian Character

Big Willy's Soap sells through its online store and at markets and retailers across Canada. The brand has built a following by proving that handmade, natural body care products don't have to be earnest, minimalist, or expensive. The humour in the branding draws customers in, but the product quality is what brings them back. For Canadians who want to support small-batch, Canadian-made body care but prefer a laugh with their lather, Big Willy's delivers on both fronts.
