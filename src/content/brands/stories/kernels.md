# Kernels

Kernels Extraordinary Popcorn opened its first location in 1983 in Toronto's Eaton Centre, popping fresh batches of gourmet popcorn right in front of customers. The concept was simple but executed with precision: start with high-quality corn kernels, pop them fresh throughout the day, and toss them with creative seasonings that went far beyond butter and salt. The smell of freshly popped corn drifting through the mall became the brand's most effective marketing tool, drawing shoppers to the distinctive storefront.

## The Flavour Pioneers

What set Kernels apart from movie theatre popcorn and bagged supermarket brands was the range of seasoning flavours. The original lineup included staples like White Cheddar, Creamy Dill, and Salt & Vinegar, but the brand quickly became known for pushing flavour boundaries. Over the years, Kernels has introduced dozens of seasonings, including Ketchup, Dill Pickle, Butter Chicken, and limited-edition collaborations. The seasonings are also sold separately in shaker bottles, allowing customers to recreate the Kernels experience at home with their own popcorn — a retail extension that significantly expanded the brand's reach.

## Mall Staple to Retail Shelf

Kernels built its reputation in shopping mall food courts, where the open-concept kiosks let customers watch the popping and seasoning process. The brand expanded to over 50 locations across Canada, becoming as much a part of the Canadian mall experience as the food court itself. Beyond the kiosks, Kernels expanded into retail, selling pre-popped bags and seasoning shakers through grocery stores and online. The retail product line brought the brand into Canadian kitchens, reaching customers who might not visit a mall regularly.

## Canadian Popcorn

Kernels remains a Canadian-owned company and uses premium North American corn for its products. The brand has maintained its focus on popcorn rather than diversifying into other snack categories, a discipline that has kept the product quality consistent across locations. In an era when many mall-based food brands have struggled with declining foot traffic, Kernels has adapted by growing its retail and online presence while maintaining its signature mall kiosks as the brand's most visible touchpoint.
