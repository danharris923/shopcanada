# Canada West Boots

Canada West Boots has been manufacturing footwear in Winnipeg, Manitoba since 1978. The company was founded with a straightforward mission: build high-quality boots and shoes in Canada using traditional construction methods and premium materials. At a time when North American footwear production was already beginning to shift offshore, Canada West committed to keeping its entire manufacturing operation in Winnipeg — a commitment the company maintains to this day.

## Goodyear Welt Construction

What sets Canada West apart from most boot makers is its use of Goodyear welt construction, a method that stitches the upper leather to a welt strip that is then attached to the sole. This technique, developed in the 19th century, produces boots that are exceptionally durable and — critically — resoleable. When the soles wear down after years of use, a cobbler can replace them without damaging the upper, giving each pair of Canada West boots a lifespan measured in decades rather than seasons. The company sources premium leathers and uses steel shanks for arch support.

## Western Heritage, Modern Range

While Canada West built its reputation on western and cowboy boots — the kind worn by ranchers, rodeo riders, and country music fans across the prairies — the product line has expanded to include work boots, dress boots, casual shoes, and the popular Moorby line of lifestyle boots. The Moorby collection bridges the gap between rugged heritage and everyday wear, offering a slimmer profile that works as well on city streets as on country roads. The WM. Moorby brand has developed a particularly loyal following.

## Made in Canada, Always

Canada West remains one of the few footwear manufacturers still operating in Canada. Every pair is handcrafted in the Winnipeg factory by skilled workers, many of whom have been with the company for decades. The boots are sold through the company's own retail store in Winnipeg, authorized dealers across Canada, and their online shop. In an industry dominated by overseas mass production, Canada West stands as proof that Canadian manufacturing can compete on quality and craftsmanship.
