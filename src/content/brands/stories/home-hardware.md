# Home Hardware

Home Hardware began in 1964 when Walter Hachborn and Henry Sittler convinced 122 independent hardware store owners across Ontario to band together as a dealer-owned cooperative. The idea was straightforward: by pooling their buying power, small-town hardware stores could negotiate prices competitive with the big chains while keeping their independence. That cooperative model remains the foundation of the company more than 60 years later.

## Dealer-Owned, Community-Rooted

Unlike Home Depot or Lowe's, Home Hardware stores are individually owned by local operators who have a financial stake in the cooperative. This structure means each store reflects its community. A Home Hardware in downtown Toronto looks and feels different from one in rural Saskatchewan, because the owner stocks what the neighbourhood actually needs. The dealer-owned model has also created fierce loyalty among store owners, many of whom are second or third-generation operators. Headquarters are in St. Jacobs, Ontario, a small Mennonite community in Waterloo Region, where the company's massive distribution centre services the entire national network.

## Four Store Formats

Home Hardware operates under four banners: Home Hardware (the traditional neighbourhood hardware store), Home Building Centre (full-service lumber and building supplies), Home Hardware Building Centre (a combination of both), and Home Furniture (home furnishings and decor). Together, the network includes over 1,000 stores across every province and territory in Canada, making it one of the country's largest independent retail networks.

## A Canadian Institution

Home Hardware has won the Reader's Digest Most Trusted Brand award in the home improvement category repeatedly, a reflection of the personal service that dealer-owners provide. Walter Hachborn, who led the company for decades and was appointed to the Order of Canada, built a business that proved small operators could compete with corporate giants if they worked together. That legacy endures in every Home Hardware store where the owner knows your name and can tell you exactly which bolt you need for your deck project.
