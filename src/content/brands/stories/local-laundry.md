# Local Laundry

Nice to Meet You: Our Story, Woven in Every Stitch Imagine slipping into a garment that not only feels good on your skin but also warms your heart. A piece of clothing that carries a mission, a story, and a sense of belonging. That’s Local Laundry. Founded in 2015 by Connor Curran and Dustin Paisley, Local Laundry began not in a fashion studio, but over a conversation about what community means, and how clothing could bring people together. The lightbulb moment came, quite literally, out of a broken laundry machine and a desire to make clothing that meant something. What if our shirts, hoodies, and hats were more than just garments? What if they were a celebration of where we’re from, a tribute to who we are, and a catalyst for giving back? From that moment, Local Laundry became more than a clothing company. We make clothing that builds community. Our mission is to build a stronger Canada, one garment at a time by supporting local manufacturing, giving back to causes that matter, and celebrating the people that make this country what it is. Proudly Canadian Made. It’s not the easy path, but it’s the right one. Every purchase supports Canadian workers, fair wages, ethical labour practices, and lower environmental impact. Read more
