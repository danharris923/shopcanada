# SAABOON

SAABOON is a one-person skincare operation based in Ottawa, Ontario, founded by Joulian Tavalloli. The brand name comes from the Farsi word for soap — "saboon" — reflecting Tavalloli's Iranian heritage and the traditional soap-making knowledge that inspired the brand. Every bar of SAABOON soap is handmade in small batches using the traditional cold-process method, a technique that preserves the natural glycerin produced during saponification and maintains the beneficial properties of the plant-based oils used in each recipe.

## Cold-Process Soap Making

The cold-process method is central to SAABOON's identity. Unlike commercial soaps that are mass-produced using industrial processes (and often aren't technically soap at all, but synthetic detergent bars), cold-process soap is made by combining plant oils with lye at low temperatures, then curing the bars for four to six weeks. This slow process produces a bar that retains natural glycerin — a humectant that draws moisture to the skin — and the nourishing properties of the base oils. SAABOON uses oils like olive, coconut, shea, and avocado, selected for their specific skin benefits.

## All-Natural Ingredients

Every SAABOON product is plant-based, all-natural, and free from synthetic fragrances, preservatives, and palm oil. Scents come from pure essential oils, and colours from natural clays and botanicals. The ingredient lists are transparent and minimal — typically five to eight ingredients that anyone can pronounce and understand. Beyond bar soaps, the product line includes body butters, lip balms, and other skincare essentials, all following the same natural ingredient philosophy.

## Handmade in Ottawa

Tavalloli handles every aspect of production — formulating recipes, sourcing ingredients, making each batch by hand, cutting and curing the bars, and packaging the finished products. SAABOON sells through its online store and at Ottawa-area markets. The brand represents the most personal scale of Canadian small business — literally one person creating each product with care — offering customers a genuine alternative to the anonymous mass production that dominates the soap and skincare market.
