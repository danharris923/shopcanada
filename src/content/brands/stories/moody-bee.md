# Moody Bee

Moody Bee is a Canadian natural beauty and body care brand that creates products using beeswax, honey, and other bee-derived ingredients as core formulation components. The brand was founded on the connection between bee products and skin health — beeswax provides a natural moisture barrier, honey is a humectant that draws moisture to the skin, and propolis has natural antibacterial properties. These ingredients have been used in skincare for thousands of years, and Moody Bee brings them into modern formulations with clean, simple ingredient lists.

## Bee-Based Formulations

Moody Bee's product line centres on beeswax-based balms, salves, lip treatments, and body care products. The lip balms are a customer favourite, offering long-lasting moisture without the waxy feel of petroleum-based alternatives. Body balms and hand creams use beeswax combined with natural oils and butters to create rich, protective formulas suited to Canadian winters. The products are free from parabens, synthetic fragrances, petroleum-derived ingredients, and artificial colours — the ingredient lists are short and recognizable.

## Canadian Bees, Canadian Made

Moody Bee sources its beeswax and honey from Canadian beekeepers, supporting domestic apiculture and ensuring ingredient traceability. All products are handmade in Canada in small batches. The brand's connection to beekeeping extends beyond sourcing — Moody Bee advocates for bee health and pollinator protection, recognizing that the ingredients central to its products depend on healthy bee populations. This genuine connection to the apiculture community gives the brand an authenticity that extends beyond marketing.

## Simple and Effective

Moody Bee sells through its online store and through select retailers and markets across Canada. The product range is deliberately focused — the brand does a few things exceptionally well rather than spreading across dozens of product categories. For Canadians looking for natural body care products with proven, time-tested ingredients and transparent formulations, Moody Bee offers a straightforward, bee-powered alternative to synthetic skincare.
