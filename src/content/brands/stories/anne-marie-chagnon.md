# Anne-Marie Chagnon

Anne-Marie Chagnon is a Canadian jewellery and accessories brand founded by multidisciplinary artist Anne-Marie Chagnon in Montreal, Quebec. For over 30 years, Chagnon has been designing bold, sculptural jewellery that bridges the gap between art and accessory — pieces that are as much wearable sculptures as they are everyday adornments. The brand has become one of Quebec's most recognized jewellery labels, known for designs that are distinctive, artistic, and unapologetically expressive.

## Wearable Art

Anne-Marie Chagnon jewellery is immediately recognizable for its sculptural quality and artistic sensibility. The collections include rings, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets crafted from pewter, resin, and mixed materials in a style that feels closer to gallery art than conventional jewellery. Chagnon explores materials instinctively, shaping and sculpting exclusive pieces that are both bold and timeless. The colour palette draws from nature and emotion, with seasonal collections introducing new tones while maintaining the brand's signature organic, fluid aesthetic.

## Made in Montreal

Every piece of Anne-Marie Chagnon jewellery is designed and produced in Montreal, with the artist maintaining creative control over the entire process. The brand's workshop produces each collection in limited quantities, and the handcrafted nature of the work means subtle variations between pieces — a hallmark of genuine artisanal production. Chagnon's conviction that "being your true self is remarkable" runs through every design, creating jewellery that encourages wearers to express their individuality rather than conform.

## A Quebec Icon

Anne-Marie Chagnon sells through her online store, her Montreal boutique, and select retailers across Canada. The brand has a devoted following among women who see jewellery as a form of personal expression and who appreciate the artistic vision behind each piece. For Canadians looking for jewellery that makes a statement, carries genuine artistic intention, and supports Canadian craftsmanship, Anne-Marie Chagnon has been delivering wearable art from Montreal for three decades.
