# Sisters Sage

The Sage Story Sisters Sage is a Tsimshian-owned wellness brand founded by Lynn-Marie Angus from the Gitxaala, Nisga’a, and Métis Nations. Based in Vancouver, BC, Sisters Sage creates self-care products with First Nations knowledge and traditional ingredients like Sage, Cedar, and Sweetgrass.

Since its start in 2018, Sister Sage has grown into an award-winning brand, recognized as Indigenous Business of the Year 2022 , BC Small Business Best Community Impact 2022 , and First National Winner of Pow Wow Pitch 2020 .

Lynn-Marie is more than a business founder—she’s an activist and community builder. With her new storefront at 1312 Kingsway, she has created a dedicated space for culture, celebration, and community, supporting other Indigenous entrepreneurs by giving them a platform to showcase their products.

She also mentors youth, guiding them to take on leadership roles and explore entrepreneurship. As a fierce advocate for the Downtown Eastside, Palestine, and human rights, Lynn-Marie uses her platform to stand up for justice and equity.

Sisters Sage’s Smokeless Smudge Spray —the leading smudge spray on the market—offers the essence of smudging in a smoke-free form. Alongside the spray, Sister Sage’s lineup includes handmade vegan soaps, bath bombs, and salves, all crafted with respect for the land and people.

Lynn-Marie is paving the way for future Indigenous entrepreneurs, sharing her teachings and vision with homes across Canada and beyond. Follow along on Instagram, join the community, and remember: Smudge well, smudge often.
