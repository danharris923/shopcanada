# Alice Sage

Our Story + Mission Founded in 2020 by Salina Morse, Alice + Sage is an Indigenous female-owned candle company based in Winnipeg, MB; Treaty 1 Territory. Alice + Sage is best known for hand-poured coconut and soy wax candles that support wellness, gathering, and joy.

It's our mission to kindly craft items that light up your life, inspire a connection & are safe for you, your family, your pets, and the environment. Meet Salina: Boozhoo! Hello! I am Salina - owner and maker at Alice + Sage.

I am Anishinaabe (bear clan) and Ukrainian, and a member of Lake St. Martin First Nation. Growing up on Treaty 2 Territory in St. Martin, Manitoba and spending so much time outdoors, I've always had a deep love and connection with nature, animals, and spirit.

Ever since I was a little girl I was drawn to the mountains and ocean. I moved to Vancouver, BC in 2010 and then to Abbotsford in the Fraser Valley in 2021 before finally making my way home to Manitoba in 2024.

I spent the majority of those years working in mental health and addiction - supporting folks in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. That's also when I really began my own journey of healing and learning how to connect to my spirit, and how essential self-care/love is to our entire well-being.

One of the questions I'm always asked is, “Why did you start making candles? ” Like so many of my ideas - it came to me in a dream. First I had a dream of making candles, and then I had another dream of making specifically soy candles and calling my business Alice + Sage.

My grandmother on my dad's side was named Alice, and she is who all of my aunties say I get my dimples from. I also have a cat named Sir Alice. He’s the big cutie you see from time to time who likes to supervise me while I make my candle creations.

Everything about ALICE really just represents love - one of our sacred teachings. As for SAGE... it represents wisdom; another one of our Seven Sacred Teachings. It’s about taking time. Slowing down. Practicing patience.

Bei...
