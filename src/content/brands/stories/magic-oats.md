I am the creator of Magic Oats. As a child, I grew up strictly on soy milk. My mom was severely allergic to dairy so this was all I knew. As time passed, I developed a hormonal imbalance so I decided to dig deeper on making some changes. One day, I came home from a specialty store with yet another plant-based milk I spent way too much money on only to check the label and discover fillers, oils, added sugar and stabilizers that made my gut and taste buds cringe - cue trash toss and follow it up with inspiration! Fuelling my obsession with healthy plant based food products I knew I could offer something better made with nutritious functional ingredients, that offered convenience, was easy to use and tasted undeniably more delicious. My mission is to share the most delicious better for you oat milk without compromise. ​ Founder: Lana
