I’m Julie the Founder & CCO (Chief Crunching Officer) at Healthy Crunch. I have always been living a fast-paced life and fueled my days with snacking. The problem is, there was no healthy option to satisfy my craving for the crunch.

As a Registered Dietitian and trained chef, I set out on a journey to to create good for you foods starting with kale chips, and evolving into our current product lineup including Kale Chips, Coconut Chips, Trail Mix, Granola Bars, Seed Butters, Instant Lattes and Chia Jams.

When I’m not working at Healthy Crunch, you can find me cooking up a storm, collecting cook books, traveling the world and keeping active with the Crunch Pups. Thanks for learning more about my journey and I can’t wait for you to try some of our products!

If you don’t know where to start, I have included some of my favs below. Happy Crunching! Julie BednarskiMHSc, PHEc, RD Let's Connect on Instagram Julie's Favourites!
