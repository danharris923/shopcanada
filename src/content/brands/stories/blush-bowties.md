Every detail is thoughtfully designed, ensuring your day is executed flawlessly, backed by over a decade of skill and dedication we’ve cultivated through years of experience. Alexandra CLEMENT McNamara Creative Director & Founder As the creative director, Alexandra blends her extensive background in the arts with a deep love for design, which she has cultivated throughout her life.

Her journey began in the world of fine arts, where she developed an eye for detail, colour, and composition—skills that seamlessly translate into her approach to event design. Over the years, she has honed her craft by studying design principles and travelling to find inspiration in various cultures, particularly drawing influence from her love of European art and culture, shaped by her time living in the UK.

This diverse foundation allows Alexandra to approach each wedding with a fresh perspective, viewing it as a space to combine artistry, creativity, and personal connection. For Alexandra, design is about more than just aesthetics; it’s about creating an experience that authentically reflects each couple’s style and values.
