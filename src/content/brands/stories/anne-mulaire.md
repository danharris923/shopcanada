# Anne Mulaire

Anne Mulaire is a Métis and Anishinaabe-owned fashion brand based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Founded by Lisa Fmakeef, the company creates sustainable women's clothing and accessories that blend Indigenous heritage with contemporary design. The brand is named after Fakeef's grandmother, Anne Mulaire, honouring the intergenerational connection to Métis culture and traditions. Anne Mulaire has earned recognition as Canada's premiere Métis fashion brand, building a national following for designs that are culturally meaningful, sustainably made, and genuinely stylish.

## Sustainable Fabrics

Anne Mulaire is built on sustainable materials. The core fabric is bamboo — a rapidly renewable resource that produces fabric that is soft, breathable, moisture-wicking, and biodegradable. The brand also uses organic cotton, Tencel (made from sustainably harvested wood pulp), linen, and recycled materials. The famous Anne Mulaire bamboo legging became the brand's breakout product, praised for comfort, durability, and environmental responsibility. The company avoids conventional polyester and nylon, choosing fabrics that align with Indigenous values of caring for the land.

## Indigenous Design and Heritage

Anne Mulaire's designs incorporate elements of Métis and Anishinaabe visual culture, including beadwork-inspired patterns and colour palettes drawn from the natural landscape. The brand collaborates with Indigenous artists and artisans to create prints and accessories that tell cultural stories. This isn't surface-level cultural branding — Fakeef's Indigenous heritage is central to the business's identity and operations, from design decisions to community relationships to the company's participation in Indigenous economic development initiatives.

## Growing Nationally

Anne Mulaire sells through its online store and through select retailers across Canada. The brand has been featured at Indigenous fashion shows, trade events, and in national media. The product range has expanded from leggings to include dresses, tops, skirts, outerwear, and accessories. Anne Mulaire represents a growing movement of Indigenous-owned fashion brands that compete on quality and design while centering cultural identity and environmental responsibility.
