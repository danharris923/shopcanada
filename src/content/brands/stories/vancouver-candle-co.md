# Vancouver Candle Co

Who we areWelcome to Vancouver Candle Co. , where each candle is a work of art and every scent tells a story. Founded with a passion for craftsmanship and creativity, our company is now led by Kathy Lee, our former production manager, who has transformed her expertise and vision into owning and guiding the brand.

Kathy, with her background in fashion design and jewelry making, brings a distinctive flair to our creations. Alongside her team of skilled artisans, she meticulously handcrafts each candle and diffuser in Vancouver.

This dedication ensures that every piece is not just a product but an experience—one that captivates and inspires. Our commitment to exceptional quality and unique scent compositions has earned us a devoted following, and we take pride in producing each candle with the same care and passion that started it all.

At Vancouver Candle Co. , we celebrate the artistry of candle making and honor the vibrant city that is our home. Discover our collections and let us light up your world with elegance and enchantment.
