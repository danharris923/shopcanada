# Sunset Grill

is Canada’s number one restaurant destination for the best breakfast and lunch! Our story is quite simple. In 1985 our founder, Angelo Christou, opened Sunset Grill’s doors for the first time in the Beaches area of Toronto, Ontario.

Armed with the basic philosophy that Fresh is Tastiest® , Sunset Grill quickly developed long lineups of loyal customers. With huge popularity and consistent service, it quickly became the place to be for the best breakfast near me .

It is said that when something works, don’t change it. After almost 40 years in business, we realize that while the world around us has evolved, our concept and methods have not changed. After all, good food, fast service and a pleasant experience is what a successful restaurant is all about.

Our food and preparation methods are 5-star inspired and quality is never sacrificed. All our menu items are cooked fresh to order using healthy methods: flat top grills, pat dry bacon and nothing is ever deep fried.

With choices such as our famous bacon and three eggs for breakfast or our flagship Sunset Burgers for lunch, we invite you try our restaurants for quality you can count on! Did you Know? The California inspired concept was named after the Don Henley hit song “Sunset Grill”.
