# Kinkd Beauty

Alysha McLoughlin founded Kinkd Beauty as a Canadian small business built on her experience as a licensed hairstylist with over eight years in the industry, including work on film and television sets. The brand grew from McLoughlin's frustration with the gap between professional-grade hair products and the overpriced, chemical-laden options available to everyday consumers. She set out to create clean, handmade products that delivered salon-quality results without the salon-quality price tag or the ingredient list full of sulfates, parabens, and silicones.

## Clean and Handmade

Every Kinkd Beauty product is handmade in small batches in Canada, using clean ingredients that McLoughlin sources and tests herself. The product line focuses on hair care, with formulations designed for a range of hair types and textures — including curly, coily, and kinky hair that mainstream brands have historically underserved. The approach is simple: use effective, plant-based ingredients, skip the fillers and synthetic fragrances, and let the results speak for themselves. McLoughlin's professional background means each product is tested in real styling situations, not just in a lab.

## The Product Line

Kinkd Beauty's range includes styling creams, leave-in conditioners, hair oils, and treatments designed to moisturize, define, and protect natural hair. The brand also offers body care products that follow the same clean ingredient philosophy. Pricing is positioned to be accessible, reflecting McLoughlin's belief that quality hair care should not require a luxury budget. Products are packaged simply and sold primarily through the brand's online shop.

## Growing a Community

Beyond selling products, Kinkd Beauty has built a community around natural hair care education and self-expression. McLoughlin shares styling tips, ingredient breakdowns, and behind-the-scenes looks at the production process. The brand represents a growing movement of Canadian small-batch beauty companies that prioritize transparency, clean formulations, and genuine expertise over flashy marketing.
