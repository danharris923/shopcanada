# Shopbop

Shopbop is an American online fashion retailer founded in 2000 in Madison, Wisconsin, and acquired by Amazon in 2006. The site specializes in curating designer fashion for women, carrying a mix of established luxury labels and emerging designers across clothing, shoes, bags, accessories, and beauty. Amazon's backing gives Shopbop the logistics infrastructure to offer fast, reliable shipping worldwide — including to Canada — while the editorial team maintains the independent, fashion-forward curation that built the brand's reputation.

## Designer Curation

Shopbop's strength is its buyer team, which curates a selection of designer brands that spans the spectrum from accessible contemporary (Madewell, Free People, Vince) to high-end luxury (Zimmermann, Ulla Johnson, Khaite). The site functions as a digital department store with a boutique sensibility — every brand carried is intentionally selected to fit the Shopbop customer's aesthetic. Shoppers can browse by trend, occasion, or designer, and the site's editorial content provides styling context that helps customers discover new brands and build outfits.

## Amazon's Fashion Play

Being part of Amazon gives Shopbop access to world-class logistics and technology while allowing the brand to maintain its own identity separate from Amazon's main marketplace. The result is a premium shopping experience with Amazon-level shipping speed and reliability. For Canadian shoppers, this means free shipping on orders over $125 CAD, free returns, and the confidence that comes with Amazon's customer service infrastructure backing every purchase.

## Shopbop for Canadians

Shopbop ships to Canada with duties and taxes calculated at checkout, so there are no surprise fees at delivery. The site offers a genuine international shopping experience that feels seamless rather than like an afterthought. For Canadian women who want access to designer brands that aren't readily available at local retailers, Shopbop provides a curated, convenient, and reliable way to shop designer fashion from home.
