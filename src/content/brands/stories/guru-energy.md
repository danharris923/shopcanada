# GURU Organic Energy

GURU Organic Energy was founded in 1999 in Montreal, making it one of the first organic energy drinks in the world. The company was created by a group of friends who wanted an energy drink that delivered real energy from natural, plant-based ingredients rather than the synthetic caffeine, taurine, and artificial colours that defined the category. GURU was organic and plant-powered years before "clean energy" became a marketing buzzword, giving the brand genuine pioneer status.

## Plant-Based Energy

GURU's formulations use organic green tea caffeine, organic guarana, organic ginseng, and organic echinacea for their energy and functional benefits. The drinks contain no artificial sweeteners, colours, or flavours — every ingredient is organic and plant-derived. The Original GURU delivers 100mg of natural caffeine per can (comparable to a cup of coffee), while other varieties adjust the caffeine level and flavour profile. The brand's sugar-free options use organic stevia leaf extract, avoiding the artificial sweeteners found in most zero-calorie energy drinks.

## The Product Line

GURU offers several varieties including the Original (sparkling with organic cane sugar), GURU Lite (reduced calories), GURU Yerba Maté, and Punch (fruit-flavoured). The cans feature clean, minimalist design that stands out against the aggressive, neon-coloured branding of mainstream energy drinks. This aesthetic signals the brand's positioning: energy for people who care about what they put in their bodies, not just the rush.

## Canadian and Publicly Traded

GURU Organic Energy Corp. is headquartered in Montreal and publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: GURU). The brand is available at major Canadian retailers including Costco, Metro, IGA, and convenience stores, as well as through Amazon and its own online store. GURU has also expanded into the United States. As the organic energy drink category has grown, GURU's advantage has been its authenticity — the brand was making organic energy drinks for over two decades before most competitors entered the space.
