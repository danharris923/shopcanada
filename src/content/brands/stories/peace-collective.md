# Peace Collective

Peace Collective is a Toronto-based apparel brand founded in 2014 with a dual mission: create Canadian pride clothing that people actually want to wear, and use every purchase to give back to local communities. The brand launched with its iconic "Home is Canada" collection and quickly became one of the country's most recognized Canadian-themed clothing labels, offering a modern alternative to the tourist-shop maple leaf merchandise that previously dominated the category.

## Canadian Pride, Modern Style

Peace Collective designs casual apparel — hoodies, crewnecks, t-shirts, hats, and accessories — featuring Canadian-themed graphics and slogans that feel contemporary rather than kitschy. The "Home is Canada" designs, city-specific collections for Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and other Canadian cities, and sports-themed collaborations have made the brand a staple at sporting events, on university campuses, and in everyday wardrobes. The designs are clean and tasteful, appealing to people who love Canada but prefer their patriotism subtle rather than loud.

## Giving Back

From the beginning, Peace Collective has built charitable giving into its business model. A portion of every purchase goes toward feeding Canadian families through partnerships with food banks and community organizations. The brand has donated millions of meals since launch, and the charitable component is a genuine part of the company's DNA rather than a marketing add-on. Specific collections are tied to specific causes, allowing customers to direct their impact when they shop.

## Toronto Made, Canada Worn

Peace Collective operates from Toronto and sells through its online store, pop-up shops, and retail partnerships across Canada. The brand has become the go-to for Canadian gift-giving — whether it's a hoodie for a friend moving abroad, gear for a big game, or a birthday gift for someone who's proud to call Canada home. For Canadians who want to wear their national pride while supporting local communities, Peace Collective makes every purchase feel meaningful.
