# Memory Express

Memory Express is a Canadian computer and electronics retailer founded in 1996 in Calgary, Alberta. For nearly three decades, the company has served PC builders, gamers, and tech enthusiasts across Western Canada with a combination of competitive pricing, deep component selection, and knowledgeable staff who actually understand the products they sell. In a retail landscape where many electronics chains have come and gone, Memory Express has endured by staying focused on what its core customers need.

## The PC Builder's Store

Memory Express carries an extensive selection of computer components — processors, graphics cards, motherboards, memory, storage, power supplies, cases, and cooling solutions — alongside complete systems, laptops, peripherals, networking equipment, and consumer electronics. The stores are designed for people who know what they're looking for: well-organized component aisles, demo stations, and staff who can discuss the merits of different chipsets and GPU architectures without reading from a script. The company also offers custom PC building services for customers who want a hand-picked system assembled by professionals.

## Price Match Guarantee

Memory Express has built a reputation for aggressive pricing, backed by a price-match guarantee that covers competitors including online retailers. This policy has made the stores a go-to for budget-conscious builders who want to ensure they're getting the best deal without sacrificing the ability to see and handle products before buying. The company runs regular sales and promotions, and its weekly flyers are closely watched by the Canadian PC building community.

## Western Canadian Fixture

Memory Express operates retail locations across Alberta and British Columbia along with a full online store at memoryexpress.com. While the company faces the same competitive pressures from online giants that challenge all brick-and-mortar retailers, it has maintained its relevance by being genuinely useful to its community — a place where you can get informed advice, competitive prices, and same-day pickup on the components you need to finish a build.
