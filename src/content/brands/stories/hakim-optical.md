# Hakim Optical

YOUR EYES CAN HAVE IT ALL AT HAKIM OPTICAL Hakim Optical began 50 years ago, when Sir Hakimi was grinding lenses for the Canadian wholesale market. He learned his craft as a youth in his native Iran and honed it in subsequent years, grinding lenses in Germany and camera lenses in Switzerland.

Attracted by the excitement of retail opportunities, Sir Hakimi began to pass the great deals he gave wholesalers on to the public. Today, Hakim Optical serves the people of Canada with 161 outlets (including 140 one-hour factory outlets) across Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.
