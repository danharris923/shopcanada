# Par Ici

Eve Tobolka and Alynne Lavigne first bonded over a shared obsession with vintage jewellery at parties and running into each-other in elevators at their university co-op building. Together, they collected and sold vintage jewellery in Toronto, New York and LA. Very naturally, the amassed vintage helped inspire the first jewellery collection Eve and Alynne designed together, PAR ICI is a Toronto based jewellery brand that values versatility, individuality, fun, and quality. All pieces are made in Toronto, and some of them have found their way to the pages of international Vogues, W Magazine, Elle, among many others.PAR ICI is grateful to live and work on the Treaty Lands and Territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit and the traditional territory of the Anishinaabe, the Wendat, and the Haudenosaunee.
