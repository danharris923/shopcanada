# Harlow Skin Co

Harlow Skin Co was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, out of founder Holly's personal need for natural self-care products that were as beautifully designed as they were effective. Dissatisfied with the options available — either clinical-looking natural products or pretty packaging hiding questionable ingredients — she began formulating small-batch skincare in her kitchen using organic, plant-based ingredients. The result was a line of products that looked like they belonged on a boutique shelf while delivering genuinely natural skincare benefits.

## Organic and Plant-Based

Every Harlow product is handcrafted in small batches in Vancouver using organic, plant-derived ingredients. The brand avoids synthetic fragrances, parabens, phthalates, petroleum-based ingredients, and artificial preservatives. Key ingredients include cold-pressed oils, botanical extracts, and essential oils selected for their skin-nourishing properties. The formulations are intentionally simple — short ingredient lists where every component serves a purpose. The brand's philosophy is that skincare should be a ritual, not a chore, and the products are designed to make daily routines feel luxurious.

## The Collection

Harlow's product range covers the essentials of a natural skincare routine: facial oils, body oils, lip balms, and bar soaps. The body oils — with names that evoke mood and intention — are among the brand's best sellers, offering hydration and aromatherapy in a single product. The bar soaps are made using traditional cold-process methods and cured for weeks before being hand-cut and packaged. The aesthetic is minimal and warm, with amber glass bottles and clean typography that have made the products popular both for personal use and as gifts.

## Small and Intentional

Harlow Skin Co operates with a deliberately small footprint. Products are sold through the brand's online shop and through select boutiques and stockists across Canada. The brand has resisted the pressure to scale rapidly or expand into dozens of product categories, choosing instead to do a few things exceptionally well. This intentional approach to growth has earned Harlow a loyal following among Canadians who value thoughtful, locally made skincare over mass-produced alternatives.
