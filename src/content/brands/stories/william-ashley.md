# William Ashley

William Ashley is Canada's leading retailer of fine tableware, home décor, and gourmet kitchenware, founded in 1947 in Toronto by Tillie Abrams — fondly known as "Mrs. Ashley." Abrams adopted the WASP-sounding name William Ashley to better market imported European goods to Toronto's affluent clientele. She opened the first store in the Danforth neighbourhood, moved to Bloor Street in the 1950s, and spent 25 years at the Manulife Centre before opening a new 15,000-square-foot flagship at The Colonnade, 131 Bloor Street West, in April 2018. The Stark family owned the business for over 50 years before Fairfax Financial Holdings acquired it in 2011. Mrs. Ashley passed away in 2010.

## The World's Finest Brands

William Ashley carries over 200 world-renowned luxury brands including Ginori 1735, Villeroy & Boch, Michael Aram, Waterford, Christofle, Riedel, Baccarat, Lladró, L'Objet, Lalique, Daum, and Hermès. The store claims the largest selection of tableware, home décor, and gourmet kitchenware in the world, spanning dinnerware, stemware and barware, flatware, home décor, and kitchen essentials. William Ashley also holds exclusive Canadian distribution for Teuscher Chocolates of Switzerland.

## Registry Pioneer

William Ashley was the first store in Canada to offer a wedding registry service in the early 1970s and the first company in North America to introduce a computerized wedding registry system. Today the flagship features a Jonathan Adler lounge serving complimentary afternoon tea, a rotating gallery wall of household objects, and personalized consultation services. The store is led by president Claudia Truchan and general manager Jackie Chiesa.

## Shopping on the Mink Mile

Located on Toronto's prestigious Mink Mile shopping district, William Ashley ships across Canada with free shipping on orders over $249. For Canadians furnishing a home, building a wedding registry, or searching for a meaningful gift, William Ashley offers nearly eight decades of expertise in fine tableware and luxury home goods.
