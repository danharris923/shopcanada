# MERIT

MERIT is an American beauty brand founded in 2021 that creates minimalist, clean beauty essentials for the five-minute makeup routine. The brand was born out of an industry crowded with fleeting trends and products that demanded expert-level skills, positioning itself as the antidote — a considered, edited collection designed to bring ease to everyday beauty. MERIT's philosophy is that great makeup should simplify your routine rather than complicate it, creating signature products you reach for daily rather than a cluttered drawer of impulse purchases.

## The Five-Minute Face

MERIT's product line is intentionally small and curated. Rather than releasing dozens of SKUs across every conceivable category, the brand focuses on multi-use essentials: a skin tint that evens tone without masking it, a flush balm that works on cheeks and lips, a brow gel that grooms and fills, and a mascara that lengthens without clumping. Each product is designed to be applied quickly — often with fingers rather than brushes — and to deliver a natural, polished result that looks like enhanced skin rather than obvious makeup.

## Clean and Timeless

Every MERIT product is formulated with clean ingredients and free from over 2,700 potentially harmful substances. The brand avoids both the filler products that pad out most beauty lines and the trend-chasing novelty launches that end up unused in bathroom cabinets. Packaging is sleek and minimal, designed to look beautiful on a counter while being practical to use. The approach is deliberately timeless — these are products meant to become permanent fixtures in your routine, not seasonal experiments.

## MERIT in Canada

MERIT is available to Canadian shoppers through its online store and at Sephora locations and sephora.ca across Canada. The brand has built a devoted following among women who want their makeup to look effortless because it genuinely is — a curated capsule of products that deliver a polished look in minutes rather than requiring a full production every morning.
