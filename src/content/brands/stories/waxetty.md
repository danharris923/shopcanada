# Waxetty

About Us Our Story Waxetty was born in Vegreville, Alberta—right around the time our home smelled amazing but the excitement of making it smell amazing had totally worn off. After years of tossing the same wax melts into the cart (usually between dog treats and toothpaste), it all started to feel like just another chore.

We missed the thrill. So, we created it. Waxetty brings back the joy of scent—fun, fresh, and anything but routine. What is Waxetty? We specialize in handcrafted wax melts made from our own premium blend of coconut, soy, and beeswax.

Every scent is carefully curated using phthalate-free and paraben-free fragrances—because you deserve the good stuff. Our melts are long-lasting, easy to use, and don’t leave behind any soot or mess. Just beautiful, clean fragrance that makes you stop and go “ahhhh…” Why We Started After countless compliments from guests saying “your house smells so pretty,” we figured it was time to stop gatekeeping and start sharing.

So we rolled up our sleeves (and probably had a wax spill or two) and got to work. Waxetty was our way of turning a simple habit into something we actually look forward to. More Than Just Wax Waxetty isn’t just a shopping cart—it’s a scent journey.

We make it easy to fall in love with your all-time faves while still leaving room for surprise hits you never saw coming. Plus, we’ve got accessories like wax liners and warmer dishes to make melting simple, clean, and kind of addictive.

Built by Family (and Supervised by Dogs) We’re a family-run business with a love for pets and playful scents. Our pups are always nearby—often “helping” by checking out the coconut waxes! Every product we make is pet-conscious, scent-sensitive, and tested in our own home before it ever reaches yours.

When you support Waxetty, you’re supporting a real family (with real dogs) doing what we love. What We Value Curiosity, creativity, and a nose for adventure Quality ingredients and handcrafted care Kindness to people, pets, and the ...
