About Natural Calm Canada Bringing Natural Calm to Canadians since 2005 Hi, I’m Linda Bolton. Together with my husband, Dale, I founded Natural Calm Canada in 2005. Natural Calm made a huge difference in my health, but at that time, it was only available in the USA.

So, starting with just a small wholesale order, I brought Natural Calm to independent health stores near Thornhill where we live. I also personally distributed hundreds of thousands of samples to Canadians across the country and raised awareness of chronic magnesium deficiency.

When people try Natural Calm, they can feel the difference quickly. Over the years, I’ve heard countless ‘before and after’ Natural Calm stories. People who had insomnia are able to sleep, thanks to Natural Calm.

Parents whose children were hyperactive are seeing their kids become calmer Adults who struggled with tension, pain, stress and anxiety are getting relief. And these are just some of the more common symptoms Natural Calm helps to resolve.

We still hear almost daily from Natural Calm fans of all ages who tell us how their health has been changed. It’s so rewarding. Today, we are the exclusive distributors of Natural Calm in Canada. Backed by thousands of five-star reviews, multiple awards and a groundbreaking clinical study, Natural Calm is truly Canada’s better-tasting, better-absorbing, best-loved magnesium.
