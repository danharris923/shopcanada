# Prana

Prana is a family-owned organic snack company headquartered in Montreal, founded in 2005 by husband-and-wife team Alon Farber and Marie-Josée Richer. The couple met while backpacking through India, where they ran a vegan seasonal restaurant in Goa before relocating to Quebec. The name means "vital energy" in Sanskrit. They started by roasting nuts in Marie-Josée's mother's kitchen with just $5,000, selling through word of mouth and farmers' markets. Today Prana is Canada's number one organic snack brand, operating out of a 60,000-square-foot SQF-certified facility in Saint-Laurent with over 100 employees.

## Organic and Plant-Based

Prana's product line includes organic nuts, seeds, dried fruits, trail mixes, nut butters, chocolate barks, coconut chips, granola bars, chia seeds, and overnight chia-oats under the Granolove brand. All products are plant-based and responsibly sourced. The Loka line features Quebec-grown pumpkin seeds produced through regenerative agriculture in collaboration with farmer Sébastien Angers in Sainte-Monique de Nicolet. Prana also sources Quebec oats and cranberries from the Mauricie region, prioritizing local ingredients where possible.

## B Corp and Beyond

Prana is the number one B Corp in the food category in Canada, certified organic, Fair Trade, non-GMO, kosher, and vegan. The company has committed to becoming a food-waste-free facility and offsets its shipping carbon through partnerships with Grassroots Carbon and Mast Reforestation. Prana calls its approach "snacktivism" — encouraging customers to make informed, sustainable food choices. The brand holds six trademarks in Canada, five in the United States, and two in Europe.

## From Kitchen to Coast

Prana products are distributed coast to coast across Canada and into the United States and parts of Europe. What started with $5,000 and a mother's kitchen has grown into Canada's leading organic snack brand — proof that a couple who fell in love in India could build something meaningful back home in Quebec.
