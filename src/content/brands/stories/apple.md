## What Apple Means to Canadian Shoppers

Apple has become part of the everyday technology landscape in Canada, present in retail locations across major cities and accessible online to shoppers in all provinces and territories.

## Canadian Jobs & Operations

Apple employs Canadians across 28 retail stores, corporate, and technical roles. Corporate positions exist in Toronto and Vancouver, covering marketing, business development, editorial work for Apple TV+, and engineering roles. The company's Canadian operations include French-language support for Quebec customers.

## Savings & Programs

The Apple Trade In program lets customers exchange older devices for credit. Education pricing reduces costs on Macs and iPads by $50-$200. The annual Back to School offer (June-September) provides free AirPods with Mac or iPad purchases through the education store.
