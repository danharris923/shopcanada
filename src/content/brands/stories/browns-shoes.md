# Browns Shoes

Browns Shoes has been fitting Canadian feet since 1940, when the Brown family opened their first store in Montreal. Over eight decades later, the company remains one of Canada's most established footwear retailers, operating around 65 locations nationwide under the Browns and B2 banners.

## A Montreal Institution

The Browns family ran the business independently for decades, building a reputation for curating designer footwear that was hard to find elsewhere in Canada. The stores became known for carrying European and American labels alongside more accessible everyday brands. In 2015, the company was acquired by Shoe Company, which itself is part of the Genesco family of footwear retailers. Despite the corporate ownership changes, Browns has retained its distinct identity as the more fashion-forward, design-conscious option in the Canadian shoe market.

## Designer Meets Accessible

Walk into a Browns location and you will find everything from Steve Madden and Birkenstock to higher-end labels like Aquazzura and Stuart Weitzman. The B2 stores focus on a younger, more trend-driven customer at lower price points. This two-banner strategy lets the company serve different audiences without diluting either brand. Online, brownsshoes.com carries the full range with free shipping and returns across Canada, a policy that has become essential for footwear retail where fit is everything.

## Staying Relevant

Browns has adapted to shifting retail habits by investing heavily in its digital presence and loyalty program. The retailer regularly collaborates with designers on exclusive collections and hosts in-store events that keep the brand feeling current. With locations concentrated in Ontario and Quebec but reaching into Western Canada as well, Browns continues to hold its ground in a footwear market crowded with international competitors.
