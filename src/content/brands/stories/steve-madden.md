# Steve Madden

Steve Madden is an American footwear brand founded in 1990 by designer Steve Madden, who started the company with $1,100 and a car full of shoes that he sold to stores in New York City. The brand quickly became known for its trend-forward women's shoes — bold platforms, chunky boots, and statement heels that captured the spirit of 1990s fashion. Over three decades later, Steve Madden has grown into a global footwear empire while maintaining its core identity as the brand that brings runway-inspired shoe trends to the mass market at accessible prices.

## Trend-Forward Footwear

Steve Madden's design philosophy has always been about translating high-fashion shoe trends into wearable, affordable styles. The brand is typically among the first to mass-market emerging footwear trends — whether that's platform sneakers, square-toe boots, strappy sandals, or the latest heel shape. The collection spans women's and men's shoes, boots, sneakers, sandals, and handbags, with new styles dropping frequently to keep the selection current. The brand also operates Dolce Vita and Betsey Johnson under its corporate umbrella.

## The .ca Experience

Steve Madden operates a full Canadian website at stevemadden.ca with pricing in CAD, local shipping, and Canadian returns. The dedicated site means Canadian shoppers get the same selection as US customers without the hassle of cross-border fees or currency conversion surprises. The brand also has retail presence in Canadian department stores and malls.

## Canadian Closet Staple

Steve Madden has earned a place in Canadian closets by consistently delivering shoes that look expensive but aren't — the kind of trend-forward footwear that gets compliments without requiring a designer price tag. For Canadian women (and men) who want their shoe collection to stay current season after season without breaking the budget, Steve Madden remains one of the most reliable names in accessible fashion footwear.
