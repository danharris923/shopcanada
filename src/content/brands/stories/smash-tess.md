# Smash + Tess

Smash + Tess is a Canadian loungewear and romper brand founded in Vancouver by friends Ashley Freeborn and Teresa Freeborn. The brand launched with its signature product — the Romperalls — a one-piece romper designed to be the most comfortable garment in your closet while still looking good enough to wear out of the house. The concept took off immediately, tapping into a growing desire among women for clothing that's cozy, flattering, and easy to throw on without sacrificing style.

## The Romperalls

The Romperalls is the piece that built the brand: a one-piece jumpsuit-romper hybrid made from ultra-soft, stretchy knit fabric that feels like wearing pyjamas but looks like an intentional outfit. Available in multiple lengths and styles — from shorts to full-length — and in a wide range of sizes, the Romperalls became a phenomenon through word of mouth and social media. Women discovered they could wear it to work from home, answer the door, do school drop-off, and lounge on the couch without changing. The brand has since expanded the concept into dresses, two-piece sets, and kids' versions.

## Comfort First, Always

Every Smash + Tess garment is designed around comfort as the non-negotiable starting point. The fabrics are soft, breathable, and forgiving — they stretch, they don't cling, and they survive the washing machine without losing shape. The brand offers extended sizing and designs that work across body types, with an emphasis on inclusive fit rather than aspirational sizing. Collections release seasonally with new prints and colourways, and popular styles regularly sell out.

## Vancouver to Your Living Room

Smash + Tess sells through its online store and at select retailers across Canada. The brand has become a go-to gift for new moms, bridesmaids, and anyone who deserves to be comfortable. For Canadian women who refuse to choose between comfort and looking put-together, Smash + Tess built an entire brand around proving you don't have to.
