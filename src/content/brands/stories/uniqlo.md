# UNIQLO

## LifeWear Philosophy

UNIQLO entered Canada in 2016 with stores in Toronto. The brand's LifeWear concept focuses on simple, versatile clothing designed to improve daily life, with technologies like HEATTECH for warmth and AIRism for breathability.

UNIQLO is known for perfect basics—t-shirts, jeans, and outerwear at accessible prices. Limited-time designer collaborations create buzz and collector's items.
