# Revolution Nutrition

Revolution Nutrition is a Canadian sports nutrition brand founded in 2007 by Maxime Gagné in Montreal. What started as a young team of health and technology enthusiasts has grown into one of North America's fastest-growing supplement companies. Revolution Nutrition owns and operates a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that is FDA registered, GMP certified, Health Canada site licensed, and holds a Safe Food for Canadians License. The fully integrated model — manufacturing directly to consumer — gives the brand control over formulation, production, and pricing, cutting out middlemen entirely.

## Products and Flavours

Revolution Nutrition produces a full range of supplements: whey protein blends and isolates, clear protein, vegan protein, pre-workout formulas, BCAAs, EAAs, creatine, vitamins, fat burners, weight gainers, and recovery products. The brand is known for its dessert-inspired and candy-flavoured supplements that make sports nutrition feel less clinical. The portfolio includes sub-brands Revolution Naturals, Red X, and Shop Bulk for customers buying in larger quantities. In 2016, Revolution Nutrition was named Brand of the Year and Most Innovative Sports Nutrition Brand at multiple major retailers across North America.

## Direct to Consumer

Revolution Nutrition ships directly from its Montreal facility to customers across Canada and internationally to over 20 countries. The company employs 200 to 500 people and also manufactures products for some of the largest retailers in the world through its contract manufacturing division. A Fitcoin Rewards program and ambassador program help build loyalty, with free shipping on all Canadian orders and tiered free product rewards at higher spending thresholds.

## Canadian-Made Supplements

For Canadians looking for sports nutrition manufactured domestically in a facility that meets Health Canada, FDA, and GMP standards, Revolution Nutrition offers a Montreal-made alternative to imported supplement brands — with the kind of flavour variety that makes daily protein intake something to look forward to.
