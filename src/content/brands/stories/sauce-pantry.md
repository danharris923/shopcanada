# Sauce Pantry

Sauce Pantry is a Canadian food brand founded by Chef Shahni, who spent over a decade in professional kitchens before channelling that experience into solving a common home cooking problem: the half-used jars of sauce cluttering up the fridge, going bad before they're finished. Sauce Pantry replaces bulky bottles and jars with compact, ready-to-mix sauce sachets that deliver fresh, gourmet flavour on demand without the waste and fridge clutter.

## Sachet Sauces

Each Sauce Pantry sachet contains a concentrated sauce mix that transforms into a full portion of sauce when combined with liquid and shaken. The lineup spans global flavours including pesto, chimichurri, hot sauces, and seasoning blends — the kinds of sauces that elevate a simple meal but are typically only available in jars far too large for a single use. The sachet format means the sauce is always fresh (no half-used jars sitting for weeks), takes up minimal pantry space, and produces zero waste from unused product.

## Chef-Crafted, Clean Ingredients

Shahni's professional culinary background shapes every recipe. The sauces use high-quality, natural ingredients without artificial preservatives, colours, or flavours. Each blend is developed to deliver restaurant-quality flavour that home cooks can achieve in seconds — just add liquid, shake, and pour. The formulations are designed to be versatile, working as marinades, dipping sauces, dressings, and cooking sauces depending on how they're mixed.

## Less Waste, More Flavour

Sauce Pantry sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The brand's sachets are priced competitively against traditional jarred sauces while delivering significantly less food waste — no more throwing out half a jar of pesto because you only needed two tablespoons. For Canadian home cooks who want gourmet flavour without the clutter, waste, and expense of a pantry full of half-used condiments, Sauce Pantry offers a smarter way to sauce.
