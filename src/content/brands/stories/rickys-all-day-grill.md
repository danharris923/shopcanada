# Rickys All Day Grill

About Us Over 60 Years of History From our humble origins as breakfast experts – to today’s menu with dozens of modern dishes for any time of the day, Ricky’s is a place where everyone feels at home. Ricky’s opened its doors in Vancouver in 1962 as Ricky’s Pancake House, famous for buttermilk pancakes, value breakfast specials, and the very best service. Ricky’s expanded in the 1980s to include full lunch and dinner. As well, in 2014, Ricky’s acquired ABC Country Restaurants, a chain that had delivered great country fare for over 40 years. This merge brought together two great brands, both with a rich history of delivering exceptional food and service to Canadian families. In 2017, the Ricky’s brand further expanded with the launch of Ricky’s Café, a new contemporary café concept with an express burger and sandwich bar and gourmet home meal takeout service. All while still serving the famous breakfasts and high quality lunch and dinner items Ricky’s is known for. With ongoing expansion, including new locations opening in Alberta and BC, Ricky’s has 85+ locations across Canada to serve you. There's Always Something New at Ricky's As the number of our locations continues to grow, so does our menu. Ricky’s breakfast menu has been enhanced to include favourites like Eggs Benedict, and our now famous Brekkie-Bowls. Lunch has everything you want with mouthwatering sandwiches and fresh never frozen ½lb Canadian Certified Angus Beef Burgers. Dinner has all your comfort foods and classics, with new foodie choices like authentic Global Bowls, succulent wine-braised Beef Short Ribs and hand-and-beer battered Fish & Chips. Good For You Good For The Planet Ricky’s is committed to uncompromising food quality and freshly prepared recipes using high quality, sustainable ingredients. We proudly serve Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee and breakfast meats raised in Western Canada without antibiotics and hormones.
