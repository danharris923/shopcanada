# 1890 Natural Bath Co.

1890 Natural Bath Co. is a Canadian small-batch bath and body care company based in Merrickville, Ontario — a picturesque village on the Rideau Canal known for its artisan shops and heritage architecture. The brand creates handmade bath bombs, soaps, scrubs, and body care products using ethically sourced, paraben-free, and family-safe ingredients. The name "1890" nods to the heritage character of Merrickville and the brand's commitment to time-tested, natural approaches to body care.

## Science Meets Nature

What sets 1890 apart from many small-batch bath product brands is the blend of wellness tradition with scientific rigour. The formulations are developed with attention to ingredient interactions, pH balance, and skin compatibility — not just thrown together from a recipe found online. Every product is crafted in small batches to ensure consistency and freshness. The ingredient lists are transparent and free from parabens, sulfates, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. Natural essential oils, botanical extracts, clays, and plant-based butters form the foundation of the product line.

## The Product Range

1890's lineup includes bath bombs in a variety of scents and formulations (some infused with CBD, others with activated charcoal or colloidal oatmeal), artisan bar soaps made using cold-process methods, body scrubs, bath salts, and specialty skincare items. The products are designed to be safe for the whole family, including children and those with sensitive skin. Seasonal collections and limited-edition releases keep the lineup fresh and give customers new products to discover throughout the year.

## Merrickville Made

1890 Natural Bath Co. sells through its online store, at the brand's retail location in Merrickville, and at markets and artisan fairs in Ontario. The Merrickville shop gives visitors a chance to experience the products in person and learn about the ingredients and production process. The brand's small-town roots and hands-on approach to production give it an authenticity that resonates with customers looking for locally made, thoughtfully crafted bath and body products.
