# Poppy Finch

In a world overflowing with excess, we believe you should know the origin, the makers, and the meaning behind the jewelry you wear. That’s why we craft pieces that are as intentional as they are beautiful — jewelry made to be worn every day and treasured for a lifetime.

Everyday Fine Jewelry, Redefined Founded in 2014 by designer Amanda He, Poppy Finch was created from a desire for fine jewelry that feels modern, timeless, and personal. We keep our entire process close to home.

Every piece is designed, crafted, and packaged in our Vancouver head office, allowing us to stay connected to our craft and the community that shapes us. We believe fine jewelry should carry meaning. Our commitment to ethical sourcing, sustainable materials, local craftsmanship, transparency, and enduring design guides every choice we make—from how each piece is created to how it’s meant to be lived in.

Poppy Finch began when Amanda couldn’t find a jewelry brand she truly resonated with. Instead of compromising, she reimagined what fine jewelry could be: modern, thoughtfully designed 14K and 18K gold pieces that feel luxurious, approachable, and deeply personal.

Amanda is deeply involved in every stage of the process - from initial sketches to final polish - ensuring each design reflects her commitment to quality, sustainability, and modern elegance. Today, Poppy Finch is carried by leading retailers and cherished by jewelry lovers everywhere.
