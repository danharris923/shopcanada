# Ergogenics

Ricky Mehta (RNC, CNP) Founder/ Nutritionist Our humble beginnings I am Ricky Mehta, founder of Ergogenics Nutrition. I have a formal education in the field of nutrition and I'm an avid snowboarder and hiker. I started this company in 2006 with the goal of making a positive change in the sports supplement world. As founder of Ergogenics, I know how hard it is to find good quailty products. I understand customers like yourself are looking for clean supplements that are free from artificial sweeteners, additives, preservatives, colours, fillers, gums, and binders. That you don’t want to see junk food flavours, you want real food ingredients that are healthy for you and your family. Ergogenics was developed to meet the needs of athletes and conscious shoppers like yourself. That’s why we operate our company with the highest degree of integrity and our products contain only carefully selected organic and non-gmo ingredients. The goal of our company is to become successful as you see success in your own well-being through the regular use of our products. We are committed to listening to our customers and delivering high quality products to help you perform your best and help with your general wellbeing. Health and Happiness, Ricky Mehta
