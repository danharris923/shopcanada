# Thai Express

Our Mission. Our Story. Our Mission At Thaï Express, we’ve learned that when you treat your taste buds right, great things happen. Through the power of flavour, our mission is to share our love for Thaï food with the world!

In 1998 a Montreal businessman fell in love with Thaïland and instinctively knew that he wanted to share his love of Thaï cuisine and bring it to North America. With the help of 4 loving south-east Asian sisters - Loune, Line, Khay and Loy - his passion project became a reality; and with that, Thaï Express came to life.

Our Story Determined to make authentic Thai food accessible across Canada , Thaï Express pioneered the quick-service Thai restaurant concept , introducing Canadians to the dynamic flavors they now love.

From a single restaurant in downtown Montreal , the brand has grown to over 300 locations worldwide , firmly establishing itself as a Canadian business success story . With the goal of bringing Thaï food to North America and making it more accessible, Thaï Express was the first quick service Thaï option and helped in introducing the dynamic flavours people have come to love.

From the first location in Montreal Quebec the brand has now grown to over 300 locations worldwide. They say it takes a village, and our village rooted from the Thongvan sisters who took a passion project and developed Thaï Express by bringing it to the next level.

After immigrating from south-east Asia, Loune, Line, Khay and Loy brought their knowledge and love from their hometown to Thaï Express. While waiting for the creation of her own Thaï Express location, Loune worked in operations and started to refine family recipes for a North American market, developed an identity and brought the idea of Thaï Express to life.

In the year 1999, Loune opened her first Thaï Express location in downtown Montreal, using the insight she gathered and developed over the years, to create a new Thaï Express concept that gained massive recognition and success.

Simultaneously with the help of her sisters Line, Khay and Loy, the team worked effortlessly behind the scenes to ensure that Thaï Express ran smoothly, efficiently and would continue to flourish within the Montreal market.

When Loune met Dennis, the Thaï Express love story evolved even further. Not only did Dennis take on the role of Business Development but the two got married in 2003 and their professional partnership blossomed even further.

The pair continued to work in collaboration with the entire Thaï Express team, evolving the brand from conceptualization to implementation, and progressing it even further. From Montreal to the World: A Canadian Franchise Success In 2004, Thaï Express joined MTY Food Group , one of Canada’s largest and most successful restaurant franchisors , further fueling the brand’s growth.

Despite expanding worldwide, Thaï Express remains deeply connected to its Canadian roots , with the founding team still involved in the brand’s development.
