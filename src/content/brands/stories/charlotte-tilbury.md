# Charlotte Tilbury

Charlotte Tilbury is a British luxury beauty brand founded in 2013 by celebrity makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury MBE. After more than 25 years working backstage at fashion shows and on red carpets — painting the faces of Kate Moss, Amal Clooney, Nicole Kidman, and dozens of other A-listers — Tilbury launched her own line to make the professional techniques and products of the fashion industry available to everyday consumers. The brand quickly became one of the most successful beauty launches in history.

## Red Carpet Beauty for Everyone

Charlotte Tilbury's product line spans makeup, skincare, and fragrance, with hero products that have achieved cult status in the beauty world. The Pillow Talk lip liner and lipstick became the bestselling lip product globally, its universally flattering nude-pink shade designed to suit every skin tone. The Flawless Filter primer-highlighter hybrid, Magic Cream moisturizer, and Hollywood Flawless Filter foundation are perennial bestsellers. Every product is designed around Tilbury's philosophy that makeup should be easy to use, universally flattering, and capable of making anyone look and feel like a movie star.

## Luxury Without Intimidation

What sets Charlotte Tilbury apart from many luxury beauty brands is the accessibility of the approach. Products are organized into curated "looks" — complete makeup routines that take the guesswork out of beauty — rather than requiring customers to be expert makeup artists. The brand's packaging is instantly recognizable: rose gold compacts with Art Deco-inspired design that look beautiful on a vanity. The price point is luxury but not prohibitive, sitting below brands like Tom Ford and La Mer while delivering comparable quality.
