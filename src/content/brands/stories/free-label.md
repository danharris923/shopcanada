# Free Label

Free Label is a Vancouver-based clothing brand that designs and produces all of its garments in Canada, with factory partners located just down the road from the brand's Vancouver studio. The team visits the factory regularly — not just for production meetings, but to maintain the personal relationships that come with truly local manufacturing. Every piece is designed in-house and sewn in small batches, and the brand knows exactly who makes every garment, from pattern cutting to final stitch.

## Designed for Real Bodies

Free Label creates clothing for women that prioritizes comfort, versatility, and inclusive sizing. The collection includes dresses, tops, pants, jumpsuits, and layering pieces designed to work across body types and life situations — from work to weekend to travel. Fabrics are chosen for how they feel against the skin and how they hold up over time, with an emphasis on soft, breathable materials that drape well and resist pilling. The designs avoid the trend-chasing cycle, focusing instead on pieces that feel current without becoming dated.

## Small-Batch, Canadian-Made

The small-batch production model means Free Label releases limited quantities of each style, reducing waste and overproduction — two of the fashion industry's biggest environmental problems. Making everything in Vancouver allows the brand to respond quickly to what customers want, produce only what's needed, and maintain quality control at every stage. The proximity to manufacturing also means lower carbon emissions from shipping compared to overseas production, and it supports local jobs in Canada's garment industry.

## Vancouver Studio to Your Closet

Free Label sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The brand has built a community of customers who care about where and how their clothes are made, and who appreciate that supporting Free Label means supporting Canadian manufacturing. For women who want a wardrobe of well-made, comfortable basics produced ethically and locally, Free Label offers something increasingly rare in the fashion industry: clothes made by people you can actually meet.
