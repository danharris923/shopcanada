# Canadian Tire

Two brothers, Alfred and John William Billes, pooled together $1,800 to buy Hamilton Tire and Garage in Toronto in 1922. They renamed it Canadian Tire Corporation and began selling automotive parts at discount prices. More than a century later, Canadian Tire operates over 500 retail locations and has become so deeply woven into the national identity that it is arguably Canada's most recognized retail brand.

## Canadian Tire Money: An Accidental Currency

The most iconic feature of Canadian Tire is its loyalty currency. Introduced in 1958, Canadian Tire money was printed to look like actual banknotes, complete with a portrait of fictional Scotsman Sandy McTire. These paper coupons became a cultural phenomenon. Canadians hoarded them in kitchen drawers, traded them informally, and some businesses even accepted them as payment. In 2014, the company launched a digital loyalty program called Triangle Rewards, though paper Canadian Tire money persisted for years alongside it. The bills have been collected as memorabilia and studied by economists as an example of private currency.

## Far More Than Tires

Despite the name, Canadian Tire evolved well beyond automotive supplies. The stores carry sporting goods, camping equipment, kitchen appliances, tools, garden supplies, holiday decorations, and seasonal items. The company also owns Mark's (workwear and casual clothing), Sport Chek (athletic apparel and gear), Atmosphere (outdoor recreation), and Party City Canada. Its private-label brands, including MotoMaster, Mastercraft, and Noma, are household names in their own right. Canadian Tire's automotive service centres remain a major part of the business, offering oil changes, tire installations, and brake repairs at locations across the country.

## A National Institution

Headquartered in Toronto, Canadian Tire employs over 58,000 people. Its stores are found in every province, often serving as the anchor of suburban shopping plazas and small-town main streets alike. For many Canadians, a weekend trip to Canadian Tire is a ritual as reliable as the seasons.
