# The Bark

Hi! I’m the owner, baker and face behind the brand. I was born and raised in Flamborough, before relocating to the London area and now have settled in North Huron. At the beginning of 2020, The Bark was in its infancy.

I was recipe testing, designing packaging and signing up for my The Bark’s first event at a Farmer’s Market. Since then I’ve branched out to many other events as well as shifting a large part of the business to wholesale.

The Bark’s products can be found in over a dozen stores in Southern Ontario. The employee line up.. I have a young son, who keeps behind the scenes interesting. My dog Finley has been the biggest daily supporter of treat production.

She has several allergies and has been a driving force for creating healthy and delicious treats for all dogs and diets. I have two horses, Fancy + Corri, who don’t reap the benefits directly from this business, but their favourite snacks fall right from the trees on our property.

I’m truly passionate about creating quality treats, made with local ingredients. Thank you for allowing me to grow this business and keep creating. Rae.
