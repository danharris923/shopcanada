# Rampage Coffee Co.

Rampage Coffee Co. is a Canadian coffee roaster with a strong connection to the military and first responder communities. The brand donates a portion of every sale to organizations that support veterans and their families, including Wounded Warriors Canada, River Valley Resilience Retreat, and The Royal Canadian Legion. Rampage was built on the belief that a morning cup of coffee can do more than wake you up — it can contribute to something meaningful.

## Bold Coffee, Strong Mission

Rampage roasts bold, high-caffeine coffee designed for people who need their brew to perform. The lineup includes whole bean and ground options in dark, medium, and specialty roasts, with an emphasis on strong, full-bodied flavour profiles that stand up to the brand's no-nonsense identity. The beans are sourced from quality growing regions and roasted in Canada in small batches. For customers who find typical grocery store coffee too mild, Rampage delivers the intensity and depth that serious coffee drinkers look for.

## Supporting Those Who Serve

The charitable mission isn't a side project — it's central to the brand's identity. Rampage Coffee Co. has built its community around veterans, active military, first responders, and the families who support them. The brand regularly participates in events, fundraisers, and initiatives that benefit these communities, and the charitable donations are ongoing rather than limited to specific campaigns. Every bag purchased contributes directly to organizations providing mental health support, rehabilitation, and community for those who serve.

## Brewing a Difference

Rampage Coffee Co. sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The brand has built a loyal following among Canadians who want their daily coffee habit to support a cause they believe in, and among coffee drinkers who simply appreciate a bold, well-roasted cup. For those who want to start their morning knowing that their coffee purchase is making a real difference for Canadian veterans and first responders, Rampage delivers on both flavour and purpose.
