# Mountain Joe

Mountain Joe is a Canadian ready-to-drink hard coffee brand created by PARK Distillery in Banff, Alberta. The product combines premium cold-brew coffee with PARK's vodka — distilled from 100% Canadian Rocky Mountain glacier-fed water — to create a canned cocktail that delivers both a caffeine kick and a smooth buzz. It's a distinctly Canadian take on the hard coffee category, rooted in the mountain town culture of Banff where après-ski drinks and outdoor adventures go hand in hand.

## The Drink

Mountain Joe Hard Coffee is a pre-mixed, ready-to-drink cocktail available in cans. The base is real cold-brewed coffee, not coffee flavouring, combined with PARK Distillery's vodka and lightly sweetened for a balanced, smooth flavour. The result tastes like a proper iced coffee with an alcoholic twist — not overly sweet, not artificial, and genuinely refreshing. The convenient can format makes it ideal for camping trips, backyard gatherings, cabin weekends, and the kind of casual outdoor socializing that defines Canadian summers.

## Born in Banff

PARK Distillery, the parent company behind Mountain Joe, is one of Canada's premier craft distilleries, located on Banff Avenue in the heart of Banff National Park. The distillery uses 100% Canadian grain and glacier-fed water from the Rocky Mountains to produce its spirits. Mountain Joe carries that same commitment to quality ingredients and local sourcing, drawing on the distillery's expertise to create a hard coffee that feels authentic to its mountain origins rather than manufactured in a corporate lab.

## Available Across Canada

Mountain Joe is available at liquor retailers across Alberta and in select provinces across Canada. The brand has tapped into the growing ready-to-drink cocktail market while differentiating itself through the quality of its coffee component and the credibility of its distillery backing. For Canadians who love their coffee and enjoy a good cocktail, Mountain Joe combines both in a single cold can.
