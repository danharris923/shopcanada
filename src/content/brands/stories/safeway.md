# Safeway

Safeway is one of Western Canada's most established grocery chains, operating stores across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Originally an American grocery company founded in 1915 in Idaho, Safeway's Canadian operations were acquired by Sobeys' parent company, Empire Company Limited, in 2013 for $5.8 billion. Under Empire's ownership, the Canadian Safeway stores continue to operate under the Safeway banner, maintaining the brand identity that Western Canadians have known for decades.

## Western Canada's Grocer

Safeway stores are full-service grocery retailers offering produce, meat, bakery, deli, seafood, pharmacy, and general merchandise departments. The stores tend toward a mid-to-premium positioning, with a focus on fresh departments and a wider selection of specialty and organic products than discount competitors. Many locations have been renovated under Empire's ownership, with updated layouts, expanded fresh food sections, and modernized shopping environments. The Safeway brand carries significant loyalty in Western Canada, where many customers have been shopping at their local Safeway for generations.

## Pharmacy and Services

Beyond groceries, most Safeway locations include in-store pharmacies offering prescription services, flu shots, and health consultations. The stores also provide floral departments, lottery services, and gift card programs. Safeway's loyalty program integrates with the broader Empire ecosystem, allowing customers to earn and redeem points across multiple Empire-owned banners.

## A Western Canadian Institution

Safeway operates stores across four Western Canadian provinces, with a presence in communities ranging from major urban centres to smaller cities and towns. The brand's longevity in Western Canada — spanning multiple decades of community presence — gives it a familiarity and trust that newer grocery entrants struggle to match. For Western Canadian families who have made Safeway their grocery destination for years, the stores continue to deliver the full-service, quality-focused shopping experience the banner is known for.
