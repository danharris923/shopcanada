# Sewn

Inspired by You Sewn is founded on the belief that every woman should embrace the skin they live in and celebrate their bodies. Our pieces are meant to allow women to feel authentically themselves -- that’s the reason why we work with sheer and lacy materials.

We take inspiration from our surroundings; flowers and the many forms the female body takes. Our pieces are truly handmade. Each style is stitched in limited quantities by a small team of women and priced fairly based on the cost of the materials, which is the main reason we don’t run seasonal sales.

We keep our quality high and our prices low, ensuring you’ll never buy one day and see it go on sale the next. Meet The Maker Alesia Alward Alesia is the owner and founder of Sewn , where her greatest joys are creating fresh designs and connecting with the community.

She's deeply passionate about keeping production local and small-batch, believing that sustainable fashion never goes out of style. When you wear a Sewn piece, you’re not only supporting ethical craftsmanship—you’re also doing something kind for the planet.

Outside the studio, Alesia enjoys nature walks, spending time with her son Beck, and embracing a new chapter focused on clean living, health, and wellness. What she loves about sewing + creating: Finding inspiration in fabrics and seasons.

Bringing new pieces into existence and having them bring joy and self love to the women who wear them.
