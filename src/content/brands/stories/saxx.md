# Saxx

The SAXX mission. To support men to be the best version of themselves through life-changing underwear that looks good, feels great, and performs where it matters. Who we are. Instigators of change. We invented men’s pouch underwear nearly 20 years ago.And we’ve been changing men’s lives ever since. We confront the uncomfortable. We take on men’s intimate problems with boldness and tenacity. We fix them. And we deliver life-changing comfort and support.Men have been dealing with discomfort for decades. But it was SAXX’s founder, Trent Kitsch, who recognized men’s discomfort and innovated to solve it. In 2006, Trent Kitsch was on a fishing expedition and after spending hours in a cold, clammy ocean suit he knew there had to be a better way to protect his package from uncomfortable chafe.As a former baseball player, he imagined a catcher’s mitt hammock design turned upside down and built into his underwear. After the fishing trip, and with the hammock idea still percolating, he worked with a seamstress and designer — and himself as the fit model — to create a paneled fabric hammock that separated his balls from his legs. Fourteen prototypes later, the BallPark Pouch® and SAXX Underwear were ready to change men’s lives. It’s an imperfect world but here are some of the ways we commit to making it better. Our sustainability mission.
