# Nature Clean

The least irritatingl ove story ever told. literally. In the early 1960s, our mother suffered allergic reactions to the harsh chemicals used in traditional household products. To help her, our dad began developing his own natural formulations.

Since then, our family has continued the tradition of creating healthier, non-toxic alternatives for the products we all use in our homes every day. Our Mission. At Nature Clean® our mission is simple.

We’re driven by a passion for protecting our natural world and believe we should all love ourselves enough to use safer products. We’re all about caring for your family's health. And chances are we haven’t even met them!

How crazy is that? The ultimate cleanfreaks of Canada. Nature Clean® is a locally owned company, helping to employ Canadians and producing Canadian made products. We're incredibly proud of our Canadian heritage.

We love telling people that our products are manufactured and packaged in Canada!
