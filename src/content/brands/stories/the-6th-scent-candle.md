Welcome to The 6th Scent Candle. The 6th Scent Candle is a soy candle company based in Langley, BC. The 6th Scent Candle started in 2016 with only the two of us, Allie and Tom. We have grown so much as a brand and company over the years through love and support from customers.

Now with a strong team and growing, we take great pride in our hand-batch production. This always ensures our 6th Scent standard of quality is met and no small detail is left out in each of our products.

We love what we do and with our hand batched process, every product from candle to diffuser gets the attention to detail that our customers have come to love For our candles, we use 100% soy wax harvested from American-grown soy beans for an eco-friendly, clean burn and lead-free cotton wicks or FSC certified wooden wicks.

All of our products are petroleum-free, cruelty-free, toxin free, sustainable and 100% vegan. Each of our products is poured and labeled by hand by our in-house team members.
