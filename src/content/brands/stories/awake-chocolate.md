# Awake Chocolate

Gather ‘round friends, and hear the tale of how Awake was hatched. From the founders We’re big believers in taking the road less traveled. You must be, if you’re planning to shake up a market where the biggest brands are literally 100 years old!

And that’s what we decided to do. It started in 2010 while working for PepsiCo (great company), when we saw an opportunity to solve a problem. You see, it turns out that a lot of people are looking for a pick-me-up to help them get through the day.

But many don’t want to drink more coffee and refuse to try energy drinks. Why? Because they don’t like the taste. Bad taste is no fun. We thought, why not make a chocolate to deliver that pick-me-up? After all, chocolate tastes great, and great taste is fun.

And why shouldn’t chocolate do more for you than just taste great? So we created AWAKE, the first functional chocolate brand. We even pitched successfully on Dragon’s Den (the Canadian Shark Tank). We risked everything and left corporate life to chase our shared dream.

Truthfully, the road has been long and difficult – COVID nearly sunk our business. That hurt, a lot. But passion and optimism are a powerful combination, so we persevered and now, with the help of our amazing team (the best in the business), our brand is thriving.

We’re a decade in, and things are really starting to happen! Adam, Dan & Matt Guiding Beliefs Taste is our north star We’re the only functional snack delivering on physical and emotional needs – because we put taste first.

Obsess over ingredients Good enough is not part of our vocabulary. We believe that less is more, so we stick to simple ingredients that are truly delicious. Do what’s right We believe you’re never wrong to do the right thing.

So, we insist on giving back to our customers, FAIR pay for our suppliers, and making responsible choices throughout our supply chain. Have fun We believe that mood matters and that smiles are contagious… so we do our level best to make our customers smile everyda...
