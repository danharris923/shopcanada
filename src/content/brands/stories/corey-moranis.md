# Corey Moranis

is a Canadian designer. For more than 10 years, she handcrafted lucite jewelry and accessories in Toronto, before closing her studio doors in 2025. Her playful and prismatic pieces were inspired by a desire to embody the incorporeal nature of light and shadow, reflections and rainbows.

Her jewelry was featured in publications like Vogue, Elle, Interview, and InStyle, carried in stores including the MoMA Design Store, the National Gallery of Canada, and Cooper Hewitt, and worn by celebrities like Addison Rae, Solange, Kelsey Lu, Jenna Wortham, and Rihanna.

Thank you for welcoming Corey Moranis gems into your world!
