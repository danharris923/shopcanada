# Sobeys

Sobeys is one of Canada's two dominant grocery chains, operating since 1907 from its roots in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. The company is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Empire Company Limited, a family-founded enterprise with over a century of experience in Canadian food retailing. What began as a small meat delivery business in a Nova Scotia mining town has grown into a national operation with over 1,500 stores across Canada under multiple banners including Sobeys, Safeway, FreshCo, Farm Boy, Foodland, IGA, and Thrifty Foods.

## Full-Service Grocery

Sobeys stores are full-service grocery retailers positioned as a premium alternative to discount chains. The stores emphasize fresh departments — produce, meat, bakery, deli, and seafood — with a focus on quality that distinguishes them from no-frills competitors. Many locations feature in-store pharmacies, floral departments, and prepared food sections. Sobeys has invested in its fresh food credentials, offering a shopping experience centred on quality ingredients for customers who care about what they're cooking.

## A Family of Banners

Empire Company operates Sobeys alongside a portfolio of regional grocery banners, each serving different markets and price points. Safeway covers Western Canada, FreshCo targets the value-conscious shopper, Farm Boy offers a premium specialty food experience in Ontario, IGA serves the Quebec market, and Foodland operates in smaller communities across Atlantic Canada and Ontario. This multi-banner strategy allows the company to serve diverse customer needs across the country.

## Feeding Canadian Families

Sobeys operates stores in every province across Canada, supported by a network of distribution centres and a growing e-commerce presence through the Voilà online grocery delivery service. The company employs over 130,000 people, making it one of Canada's largest private-sector employers. For Canadian families, Sobeys has been a trusted grocery destination for over a century, delivering quality food and community presence from coast to coast.
