# Canada Computers

Canada Computers is one of Canada's largest computer and electronics retailers, founded in 1991 by Gordon Chan in Kingston, Ontario. What started as a small shop serving local computer enthusiasts has grown into a national chain with over 35 retail locations across Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. The company has built its reputation by offering competitive pricing, a massive selection of computer components, and the kind of technical expertise that big-box electronics retailers simply can't match.

## For Builders and Buyers

Canada Computers serves two distinct customer bases: PC builders who want individual components like CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, and storage drives, and general consumers looking for laptops, desktops, peripherals, and electronics. The stores carry a depth of selection in the component category that rivals online retailers, with the advantage of being able to see, touch, and compare products in person. For custom PC builders, Canada Computers is often the first stop — offering everything needed to assemble a system from scratch under one roof.

## Competitive Pricing

The company is known for aggressive pricing that frequently matches or beats online-only retailers, making it one of the few brick-and-mortar chains where tech-savvy shoppers don't feel like they're paying a premium for the convenience of a physical store. Regular sales, bundle deals, and a price-matching policy keep prices sharp. The company also offers system assembly services, warranty programs, and repair services through its retail locations.

## Canadian Tech Retail

Canada Computers operates its stores and a full e-commerce platform at canadacomputers.com, offering shipping across Canada. With over three decades in business, the company has survived multiple waves of disruption in electronics retail — from the rise of Amazon to the decline of competitors like Future Shop and NCIX. For Canadian tech enthusiasts and PC builders, Canada Computers remains a vital part of the ecosystem, offering the selection, pricing, and expertise that keep customers coming back.
