We believe the world is a better place with coffee that is sourced ethically and grown organically. At Equator, coffee is more than just a beverage; it is a way of changing the world. We've been roasting, delivering, and serving fresh, fair trade, organic coffee since 1998.

Founded by Craig and Amber Hall with the goal of making a difference globally and locally, the name was chosen for a reason: to ‘Equate’ the benefit of drinking coffee, not just for the consumer but for all the people along the way, from our staff who pack and serve it- to the farmers who grow it.

Where it all began In 1998, after graduating with a degree in International Development, Craig decided to apply his studies and start a business that aimed to bring more benefit to vulnerable coffee farmers.

He had learned about "fair trade coffee" and focused his business on roasting fair trade, organic coffee. Little did he know this movement would spark the “direct trade” coffee craze many years later.

From the start, Craig and Amber's goal has been to "equate" the benefit of drinking coffee. For the first couple of years, Amber continued in her role as a high school teacher to support the business start up, but joined the business in 2000 and became 50% owner along with Craig in 2011.

World changing coffee 20+ years (and many lessons learned! ) later, Craig, Amber, and the whole Equator team are still driven by the cause: to roast, deliver, and serve 100% fair trade, organic specialty coffee.

Combining our love of people with our love of great coffee, we've been blessed to help shine a bit more light in an industry with a dark history (and a lot of bad coffee! ) Our goal is to let that light shine brighter with every customer who hears the story, every staff member who tells the story, and every producer partner who lives it!
