# Routine

Routine is a Canadian natural personal care brand founded by sisters Neige and Pippa in Calgary, Alberta, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The brand launched with a single product — natural deodorant — and built a cult following by proving that aluminum-free deodorant could actually work. What started in a home kitchen has grown into one of Canada's most recognized natural personal care brands, known for products that smell incredible, perform reliably, and are packaged with environmental consciousness.

## The Deodorant That Started It All

Routine's natural deodorants are the brand's flagship and the product that put them on the map. Available in a wide range of scents — from sweet florals to earthy musks to bright citrus — the deodorants use baking soda, magnesium, and probiotics to neutralize odour without blocking sweat glands the way aluminum-based antiperspirants do. The brand also offers baking soda-free formulas for sensitive skin. Packaged in glass jars and cardboard tubes, the deodorants avoid the single-use plastic that dominates the category.

## Expanding the Routine

Beyond deodorant, the brand has expanded into a full personal care line including body cream, face oil, lip balm, dry shampoo, and sexual wellness products. Every product follows the same principles: natural ingredients, beautiful scents, effective formulas, and thoughtful packaging. The brand is certified cruelty-free and uses organic, fair-trade, and sustainably sourced ingredients wherever possible. Scent is a defining characteristic — Routine treats fragrance as an art form, creating complex, layered scent profiles that rival conventional perfumery.

## Rocky Mountain Roots

Routine products are made in Calgary and sold through the brand's online store, Whole Foods, and hundreds of independent retailers across Canada. The sisters have built the brand with a distinctive personality — playful, confident, and unapologetic about the fact that natural products should be a joy to use, not a compromise. For Canadians making the switch to natural personal care, Routine has become the brand that makes the transition easy and enjoyable.
