# John Fluevog

Over 50 Years of Fluevog John Fluevog has come a long way since his humble beginnings in 1970 as a partner in the Vancouver shoe store, Fox and Fluevog – and boy, what a ride! Let us take you on a linear journey through the Fluevogian decades and simultaneously prove that timelines are a) awesome and b) not just for history class.

Prepare for tears, laughter, and a deep understanding of the unconventional (dare we say, life-changing? ) history of John Fluevog Shoes. The beginning of time (and Fluevog) 1970 1970s After spending a summer hitchhiking down the west coast and witnessing the 1960s Social Revolution firsthand, John returns to his hometown of Vancouver and begins working for Sheppard’s Shoes.

In 1970, he joins forces with fellow co-worker Peter Fox to start up their own shoe store in historic Gastown. The partnership, known simply as Fox and Fluevog, lasts over ten years at which time the two split amicably, leaving John to open the first John Fluevog Shoes in downtown Vancouver.

1970 The earliest Fox and Fluevog shoes were made from turn-of-the-century footwear that had been discovered in a Mexican warehouse and purchased on the spot by John. The duo advertised their shoes as “Brand new 50 year old shoes”.

1970 One of John’s first designs was The Pilgrim, a Victorian-inspired buckle T-strap loafer. The boldness of the style was completely against the mainstream of the time, and John has kept it unconventional ever since!

1970 Fox and Fluevog open their first store in the heart of Gastown, Vancouver. 1971 Director Robert Altman buys a knee-high boot while filming McCabe and Mrs. Miller. 1973 The Granville Street store opens and will eventually become one of the longest lasting Fox and Fluevog stores.

The building was an elaborate bedroom with their shoes gracing a giant bed. John expands his grasp into the land of the brave 1980 1980s With the end of the Fox and Fluevog partnership, John Fluevog Shoes is born.

Feeling the urge to go forth and spread his word, John expands his grasp into the Land of the Brave. By the late 1980s, John had started producing his landmark Angel Soles. Made from 100% natural latex harvested from the Hevea Tree, the tough, resoleable Angel Soles recite the now famous JF message engraved on the sole: Resists alkali, water, acid, fatigue and Satan.

1980 - 1989 John was (possibly) the first person to sell Doc Martens in North America and he sold his styles right along next to them. Sometimes, he’d take the idea and embellish them. One of his first adaptations had leopard print and pink pony skin uppers.

1985 John sells his Jaguar to open his second store, this time in Seattle. 1985 The Angel Soles first appear to John in a celestial dream, or in the form of a pamphlet collected by him in a recent shoe fair in Birmingham, England.

1987 Fluevog continues to expand into the United States and opens a store in Boston. 1989 Fluevog Shoes opens on Toronto’s Queen Street.
