# Wok Box

“What if we could eat Asian food out of boxes just like in the movies? ” That’s all it took for Wok Box to be born. Shortly after opening in 2004, there was a line around the block. That was the moment when founder Blair Stevens knew he had something very special.

From our first location on Jasper Avenue in Downtown Edmonton, Alberta, to over 60 stores today from British Columbia to Newfoundland, Wok Box continues to have something for everyone and is loved by young and old alike.

As we celebrate our 20th anniversary in 2024, we reflect on how far we’ve come while staying true to our mission of providing fresh, flavourful meals. Whether it’s offering vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-friendly options, or putting a contemporary twist on traditional dishes, Wok Box infuses every meal with great flavour AND the highest quality ingredients.

At Wok Box, it really is more fun in a box. Come in for the food and stay for the experience.
