# Omi Woods

About Omi Woods jewelry are contemporary heirlooms that celebrate Island and Africana culture. Our jewelry is handmade with responsibly sourced and recycled gold and silver, fine metals and natural gemstones.

Our jewelry is meant to be worn daily, lived in fully, and passed down intentionally. 'I used jewelry to explore my heritage from the Caribbean, to West and North Africa, across to East Africa, and down the Nile to ancient Nubia.

I hope our jewelry inspires you to explore and celebrate your unique culture and the beautiful diversity of world jewelry traditions'. - Ashley Alexis McFarlane, Founder, Omi Woods info@omiwoods.
