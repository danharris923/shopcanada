# Abercrombie & Fitch

Abercrombie & Fitch is an American fashion brand with roots dating back to 1892, when it was founded in Manhattan as an elite sporting goods retailer outfitting the likes of Theodore Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway. The brand transformed dramatically in the 1990s under CEO Mike Jeffries into a youth-focused casual clothing label known for its dark stores, loud music, and cologne-soaked shopping experience. In recent years, Abercrombie has undergone another reinvention, repositioning itself as a quality casual wear brand for adults with a cleaner, more inclusive identity.

## The Reinvention

The modern Abercrombie & Fitch has shed much of its controversial past — the exclusionary marketing, the shirtless models, the aggressively branded everything. Today's Abercrombie focuses on well-made casual clothing: quality denim, cozy knitwear, tailored outerwear, and everyday essentials in a sophisticated neutral palette. The quality has notably improved, with the brand investing in better fabrics, construction, and fits that appeal to an older, more style-conscious customer than the teenager demographic it once chased.

## Canadian Presence

Abercrombie operates a dedicated Canadian site with pricing in CAD and ships to addresses across Canada. The brand also maintains retail locations in major Canadian shopping centres. Canadian shoppers have access to the full Abercrombie collection alongside the brand's Hollister sub-label, which continues to target a younger demographic.

## Worth a Second Look

For Canadians who dismissed Abercrombie based on its 2000s-era reputation, the brand's current iteration is genuinely worth revisiting. The quality-to-price ratio has improved significantly, particularly on denim, outerwear, and knitwear. The designs are versatile and understated, suitable for professionals and adults who want casual clothing that looks intentional. Abercrombie's reinvention is one of the more successful brand turnarounds in recent retail history, and Canadian shoppers benefit from a brand that's finally delivering on quality rather than hype.
