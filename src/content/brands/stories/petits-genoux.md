# Petits Genoux

Hi! I Am Kendra Francis, Founder and Creative Director of Petits Genoux. Petits Genoux began as a happy accident in between drop off and pick up at preschool, between another mom and I. A super stylish travel writer and myself, creating pieces for our #newprojects.

In a few months we had a line and a few weeks later, an order and then voila, Petits Genoux was born. No plan, no bank account, no website, but we pulled it together and had an opening in our first vendors boutique and I was right back into the swing of things.

A vast new, shiny space called Childrens Clothing was breathing a new vibrant energy into me. The entrepreneurial spirit is a bit of a phenomenon to some. They question the struggle, the inconsistencies, the highs and deep lows.

Those are the things that keep me in it, it’s like survivor or the amazing race, non-stop and never ending. I am a creator, and and don’t think I will ever stop. I pride myself in the quality and integrity of my work and hope when it goes out into the world that it’s received that way because, it really is in my blood...

I hope you these pieces bring you joy. Kendra ********** Petits Genoux / puh-tee . jUH-nu was created for the littlest ones in our lives. Eco-conscious, socially-conscious, and gender-neutral, Petits Genoux is great gifting for any child.
