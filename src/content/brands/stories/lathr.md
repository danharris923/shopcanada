# Lathr

Our Story At Lathr, it all started in our garage. I’m Frank, the founder, and what began as a fun way to make soap with my kids quickly grew into something much bigger. As we experimented with ingredients and fragrances, we realized that creating clean, effective grooming products wasn’t just a hobby—it was a passion.

Over time, we’ve grown from our humble beginnings into a brand committed to bringing you high-quality products that are safe, simple, and trusted. Get to Know Lathr: Our Story, Our Passion Our mission at Lathr is simple: to create grooming essentials that you can rely on.

We know that what you put on your skin matters, which is why our products are always free from parabens, sulfates, and other harsh chemicals. If it’s safe enough for my family, it’s safe enough for yours.

That’s the promise we stand by every day. The Heart of Lathr When you choose Lathr, you're not just buying a product—you’re joining a community. We’re proud of the family values that shaped Lathr, and we consider every customer part of that family.

We’d love to hear from you, whether it’s feedback on our products or stories of how you’ve incorporated Lathr into your routine. What's Next for Lathr? As we continue to grow, we’re dedicated to keeping our roots intact.

We’ll keep making products that you can trust, with clean ingredients and handcrafted quality.
