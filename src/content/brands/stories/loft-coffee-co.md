# Loft Coffee Co

why you'll love loft! We are a small batch, single-origin, specialty coffee roaster. You can find us in a barn loft in DeWinton, just south of Calgary Alberta, Canada. Yes, we said barn, but it's really cool!

​ We think coffee should always be fresh. That’s why we mark the roast date, by hand, on each bag we send out. We’re small enough to do so and we’re perfectly happy about that. We’re not looking for world domination, we just want to roast great coffee.

​ ​ ​ It's all about the flavour: Oh and we’re also a big believer in ‘single origin’ coffee. That means, when you purchase our coffee, you’ll be tasting the results of hardworking farmers from specific regions of various countries of the world.

Some of these ‘micro-regions’ are found in very remote, small corners of the coffee-growing globe. ​ Why would we choose to blend those with cheaper, large-scale, lower-quality coffee operations? We prefer to pay a little more, bring them in as green beans and roast them in small batches.

​ We showcase the region’s unique flavor profile! It never ceases to amaze us how different coffee can be. Fruity coffee? We’ve got a region for that. Chocolate? Yup. Regardless of your flavor bias or roast preference, one thing we know for sure.

You’ll always get a freshly roasted, higher quality, great-tasting coffee that’s full of unique flavor.
