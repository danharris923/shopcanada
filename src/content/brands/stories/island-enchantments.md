# Island Enchantments

My Story I still remember the moment I realized I needed something better for my skin. I’d tried just about every commercial product under the sun—creams, lotions, washes—yet nothing seemed to soothe my eczema, sensitive skin, or stubborn acne.

Frustration set in, but it also sparked an idea: what if I could make my own skincare, using gentle, natural ingredients that actually helped my skin feel healthy again? That question led me down a path I never expected—straight into the art of soap-making and custom cosmetics.

Not only did I discover how transformative high-quality, handmade products can be, but I found a renewed connection to the place I’ve always called home: Vancouver Island. From my early days in Campbell River and Comox, through the cozy community of Cumberland, right down to the rugged shores of Sooke and now Victoria, this island has always felt like a magical force in my life.

So when I set out to bring my skincare creations to others, it felt natural to reflect that same sense of enchantment. Welcome to Island Enchantments. When I name a soap “Salish Sea Siren,” it’s not just a catchy label—it’s a nod to the serene waters and breathtaking vistas that have shaped my worldview.

Every bar of soap, every soothing balm, and every fizzing bath bomb embodies the diverse beauty I see around me daily. My hope is that, through these products, you’ll feel just a bit of that island spirit in your own home, whether you’re down the road in British Columbia or thousands of miles away.

I pour countless hours into researching and selecting the best ingredients—real oils, nourishing butters, and gentle botanicals—so that each product feels luxurious yet safe for sensitive skin. It’s important to me that everything I make remains free from harsh chemicals, because I know firsthand how frustrating it is to use a product that promises relief but only makes things worse.

Meticulous care goes into each formula, from testing its gentleness on the skin to making sure it has that special “spark” I like to call the Island Enchantments touch. More than anything, my mission is to share a piece of Vancouver Island with anyone who needs a little extra magic in their day.

Maybe you’re looking for a gentle soap that doesn’t irritate eczema, or you’re craving the soothing scents of lavender or sea salt. Perhaps you just want to treat yourself to something that feels handmade and heartfelt.

Whatever brings you here, I’m so glad you’ve decided to join me on this journey. I invite you to explore our selection of soaps, lotions, lip balms, serums, bath bombs—each one crafted in small batches with the same attention I’d give a close friend or family member.

When you purchase something from Island Enchantments, you’re not just getting a skincare product; you’re supporting a dream that began in a kitchen where frustration turned into curiosity, and curiosity blossomed into a passion for handmade skincare.
