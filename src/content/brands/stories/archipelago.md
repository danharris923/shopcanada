# Archipelago

Archipelago is a Vancouver-based food and beverage company that imports and distributes products directly sourced from Indonesia. The company works closely with small and medium-sized enterprises across the Indonesian archipelago, selecting and curating high-quality products for the North American market. Archipelago operates at the intersection of quality, value, and social impact — each purchase supports Indonesian producers and communities.

## Indonesian Flavours

Archipelago's product range includes specialty foods and beverages that showcase the rich culinary diversity of Indonesia — a country comprising over 17,000 islands, each with its own food traditions. The selection features items like sambal sauces, spice pastes, teas, coffees, snacks, and pantry staples that are staples of Indonesian cuisine but often difficult to find in quality versions in Canada. Each product is sourced directly from Indonesian producers, ensuring authenticity and fair pricing for the makers.

## Direct Trade, Social Impact

The company's sourcing model prioritizes direct relationships with Indonesian SMEs, cutting out middlemen and ensuring that more of the purchase price reaches the producers. This direct trade approach supports local economies, preserves traditional food production methods, and provides Indonesian businesses with access to the Canadian market. Archipelago's commitment to social impact goes beyond fair pricing — the company actively selects partners who maintain ethical labour practices and sustainable production methods.

## Bringing Indonesia to Canada

Archipelago sells through its online store and at select retailers in British Columbia and across Canada. The brand serves both the Indonesian diaspora in Canada — who are looking for authentic tastes of home — and adventurous Canadian food lovers discovering Indonesian flavours for the first time. For anyone looking to explore one of the world's most diverse and flavourful cuisines through quality, ethically sourced products, Archipelago brings Indonesia's best to Canadian tables.
