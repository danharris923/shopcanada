# Subi

Subi is a Canadian wellness brand based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that makes getting daily greens simple with its superfood drink mixes. The brand was founded on the idea that most people know they should eat more vegetables and superfoods but struggle to do it consistently — between the cost of fresh produce, the prep time, and the fact that kale smoothies aren't exactly delicious, healthy eating has too many barriers. Subi set out to remove them.

## The Greens Mix

Subi's flagship product is the Greens Super Juice Mix, a powder blend of over 20 whole-food ingredients including spirulina, chlorella, matcha, wheatgrass, and a range of fruits and vegetables. One scoop mixed into water or a smoothie delivers a concentrated dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The formula uses only natural, whole-food ingredients — no synthetic vitamins, artificial sweeteners, or fillers. The taste is designed to be genuinely pleasant rather than the earthy, swamp-water experience that many greens powders deliver.

## Real Ingredients, No Shortcuts

What distinguishes Subi from the crowded greens powder market is the commitment to whole-food sourcing. Every ingredient is a recognizable food, not a lab-synthesized vitamin isolate. The brand avoids proprietary blends that hide ingredient quantities, instead listing exact amounts on the label so customers know what they're getting. Products are vegan, gluten-free, and non-GMO, and the brand is transparent about where ingredients are sourced and how they're processed.

## Vancouver to Your Door

Subi sells through its online store and ships across Canada and internationally. The brand has built a community of health-conscious Canadians who appreciate the convenience of getting their daily nutrition in a single scoop rather than buying, storing, and prepping a grocery cart full of superfoods. For people who want the benefits of a nutrient-dense diet without the time and expense of juicing, Subi offers a practical daily solution.
