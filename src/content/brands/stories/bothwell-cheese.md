# Bothwell Cheese

MEET BOTHWELL CHEESE The tradition of Bothwell is a tradition of quality. Bothwell Cheese has been producing high quality and award-winning cheeses since 1936. We believe the highest quality and best tasting product come from cheese made with 100% pure Canadian milk.

There are no artificial ingredients, preservatives or modified milk ingredients used in the production of our cheeses. In addition, we use state-of-the art machinery to create an age-old, natural product.

In the beginning, there was... Milk Milk is the cornerstone of Bothwell Cheese. It all starts with fresh, 100% MILK. additives fillers artificial colours preservatives antibiotics hormones We only use pure milk.

Many dairy products produced and sold in Canada contain modified milk ingredients. Imported milk ingredients used in these products may contain antibiotics and synthetic growth hormones. The Dairy Farmers of Canada Quality Milk symbol was created in response to consumers who wanted to know the origin and contents of their food on the packaging.

Buying products that bear the Dairy Farmers of Canada Quality Milk symbol guarantees 100% Canadian milk ingredients , no antibiotics, no synthetic growth hormones, and a product that supports local dairy farmers and the economy.

Locally Sourced Ingredients Forging strong ties with our dairy community & our neighbours. We love the connected world we live in, but feel strongly about making cheese with fresh, local ingredients. For that reason, 98% of our ingredients come from within 100 km of where our cheese is crafted.

We are proud to say local dairy farmers still supply all the fresh milk for our cheese. Cheese Plant Bothwell produces between 24,000 and 29,000 kg of cheese per day. Quantity is a factor... One milk truck tanker holds upwards of 22,000 L of milk.

One of our cheese-making vats hold 22,000 L of milk. Huge blocks of cheese are packaged, refrigerated and aged in 19 kg bricks. We are a proud producer of award-winning cheddar cheeses, like Marble, which is a family favourite.

Besides that one, we offer a wide variety of Mild, Medium, Old and Extra Old traditional cheddars, as well as Maple Smoked and Red Wine Old Cheddar, which are the perfect companions for every charcuterie board.

And that's just cheddar. We also produce over two dozen varieties under our other categories of cheese: Premium, Spicy, Unique, Lactose-Free, Fresh Curds, and Sliced Cheese. As a company with a long history of introducing innovation in cheese, we developed "Sunny Dog Cheese," a new and exciting brand that's part of the Bothwell Cheese family.

Sunny Dog includes two fun, flavourful varieties that are part of our Unique line of cheeses - Herbs & Garlic Cheddar and Spicy Dill Pickle Monterey Jack. Growth is important to us and so is answering the demands of our customers.

In April 2022 we launched a line of 250g naturally Lactose-Free cheeses. People with lactose intolerance can enjoy these cheeses without sacrificing quality, taste, or texture.
