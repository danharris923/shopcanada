# Educated Beards

Educated Beards is a Canadian men's grooming brand founded by a military veteran in New Brunswick. The company produces premium beard care and grooming products using certified organic, 100% natural ingredients. The brand was born from the founder's own experience growing and maintaining a beard, and the frustration of finding products that were either full of synthetic chemicals or didn't perform well enough for serious beard care. Every Educated Beards product is Ecocert and COSMOS Organic certified — the highest international standard for organic personal care products.

## Certified Organic

What sets Educated Beards apart in the crowded men's grooming market is its rigorous organic certification. Ecocert certification requires that a minimum percentage of ingredients be organic, that no synthetic fragrances or petroleum-derived ingredients are used, and that manufacturing processes meet environmental standards. Most beard oil brands that claim to be "natural" don't hold any third-party certification. Educated Beards' commitment to the Ecocert standard means every ingredient is verified, every claim is auditable, and customers know exactly what they're putting on their skin.

## The Product Line

The range covers the full beard care routine: beard oils formulated to condition facial hair and moisturize the skin underneath, beard balms that provide hold and shape, beard washes that clean without stripping natural oils, and moustache wax. The brand also produces shave products and hair care items. Each product line comes in multiple scent profiles using essential oils — no synthetic fragrances. Popular scents include combinations of cedarwood, bergamot, vanilla, and citrus. The packaging is clean and masculine, with amber glass bottles that protect the organic oils from light degradation.

## Veteran Owned, Canadian Made

Educated Beards manufactures all products in Canada and is a certified veteran-owned business. Products are sold through the brand's online store and through select barbershops, salons, and retailers across Canada. The brand has built a loyal following among bearded men who take grooming seriously and who value products that meet the highest standards of organic certification — proof that effective men's grooming doesn't require synthetic chemistry.
