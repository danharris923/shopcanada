# Big Bear Trading Company

Locally owned and operated, a mountain lifestyle premier shopping experience. Located in the Canadian Rockies, we created an experience to reflect the great outdoors and awe inspiring setting in which we are located, with the philosophy that we are more than just a store.

Each detail and design feature are curated to stand out from the crowd, but most importantly to capture the the beautiful mountain surroundings that we call home. We’re proud to call ourselves a premiershopping experience, and we'd love for you to come and see why.

MEET THE FAMILY BEHIND BIG BEAR TRADING COMpanyChelsea and Jon moved to Canmore in 2014 and quickly fell in love with the community and mountain culture. Inspired by the magnificence of the Canadian Rockies and its wildlife, we opened our first Big Bear Trading Co location in Banff in June 2021, during the pandemic.

After an incredibly strong response, we brought a second location to Canmore in October 2022. Not only are we locally owned and operated,we’re also a family business. The Cudmore family has been in retail for 111 years!

Originally from Prince Edward Island, the family business began with Thomas Roy Cudmore, Chelsea's great grandfather, as a Haberdashery and followed with her grandfather, Brian. The business continued with Chelsea’s parents,Chris and Beryl Cudmore, who pivoted to resort retail in 2001.

Now Chelsea, and her brother Devon lead the family business. Curated Collection of Mountain INspired Apparel & GiftsWe’ve carefully chosen a collection of products that reflect the mountain lifestyle of the Canadian Rockies.
