# Buck Naked Soap Company

Buck Naked Our Story Buck Naked was born out of necessity. When baby Elias, son of Buck Naked founders Rina and John, developed skin irritations from traditional baby products, they soon realized they needed a truly natural alternative.

As necessity is the mother of all invention, the Chamomile & Calendula Soap was invented to help soothe the little guy’s skin. With this creation, Rina discovered her passion of formulating skin care products using the purest of ingredients.

Since inception, we’ve introduced a full line of all-natural, vegan, handcrafted skin care products. We’re committed to being chemical-free, using only pure, natural ingredients. On this, we are unwavering: if you can't (or shouldn’t) eat it, we won't use it.

Why Natural? Our skin is our body’s largest organ. We don't often think about it, but it’s our first line of defense against potentially harmful bacteria and contaminants. The thin layer of sebum that covers our bodies works like an invisible shield.

At 22 incredible square feet, our skin deserves to be nurtured and nourished with the best quality of ingredients. However, our skin is also porous, which means that between 13% (the bottom of our feet) and 100% (underarms and groin) of the products we put onto our skin is absorbed within 26 seconds.

Although federally-approved, many traditional products contain a variety of chemicals that soak into our skin and bloodstream in that 26-second window and potentially disrupt our bodies' natural balances.

Some chemicals, like sodium laureth sulfate (a detergent and lather booster), can contain contaminates that are considered possible human carcinogens – harmful to the nervous system, and classified as possible developmental toxicants.

This is why Buck Naked Soap Company makes only natural skin care products.
