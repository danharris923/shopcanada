## What Costco Means to Canadian Shoppers

Costco has become a fixture in Canadian household shopping routines, known for bulk groceries sold at prices that often undercut traditional supermarkets. Membership warehouses anchor suburban retail plazas across the country.

## Canadian Jobs & Operations

Costco employs over 30,000 Canadians across warehouse staff, management, logistics, corporate offices, and specialized departments like pharmacy, optical, and tire services. The company is known for paying above-minimum wages and offering benefits that include health coverage, retirement plans, and performance bonuses.

## Membership & Savings

Gold Star membership costs $60/year. Executive membership ($120/year) includes a 2% annual reward on most purchases. Costco's return policy is among the most generous in Canadian retail—most products can be returned at any time for a full refund.
