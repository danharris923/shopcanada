# Nasty Gal

Nasty Gal is a fashion brand founded in 2006 by Sophia Amoruso, who started selling vintage clothing on eBay from her small San Francisco apartment. The brand's name was borrowed from a Betty Davis album, and its attitude matched — bold, unapologetic, and aimed at young women who wanted to dress with confidence and edge. Nasty Gal grew from a one-woman vintage shop into a multi-million dollar fashion brand before going through bankruptcy in 2016 and being acquired by the UK-based Boohoo Group in 2017.

## Edgy, Bold Fashion

Nasty Gal's aesthetic has always leaned into the provocative and trend-forward: bodycon dresses, leather jackets, platform boots, cutout tops, and statement pieces that aren't designed for blending in. Under Boohoo's ownership, the brand operates as a fast-fashion label offering rapid trend turnover at accessible price points. New styles drop constantly, covering going-out looks, festival wear, party dresses, and the kind of bold everyday fashion that makes a statement. The pricing is aggressive, with frequent sales and promotions that make trend experimentation affordable.

## The Girlboss Legacy

Sophia Amoruso's entrepreneurial story — from dumpster-diving vintage seller to fashion mogul — became the basis of her bestselling book "#Girlboss" and a Netflix series of the same name. While Amoruso is no longer involved with Nasty Gal, the brand's origin story helped define a generation's entrepreneurial aspirations and remains one of the most notable e-commerce success stories of the 2000s.

## Nasty Gal in Canada

Nasty Gal ships internationally to Canada through its website, offering Canadian women access to its full range of trend-driven fashion. For Canadian shoppers who want bold, affordable style that leans into the latest trends rather than playing it safe, Nasty Gal delivers fast fashion with an attitude.
