# Thoughtfully

Thoughtfully is a gifting company that creates curated gift sets and experience kits designed to make gift-giving easy, personal, and memorable. Rather than selling individual products, the brand assembles themed collections — cocktail making kits, hot sauce challenge sets, tea tasting experiences, candy assortments, and more — packaged in presentation-ready boxes that are ready to give the moment they arrive. The concept eliminates the stress of assembling a gift yourself while delivering something more personal than a gift card.

## Curated Gift Experiences

The Thoughtfully product line spans dozens of themed gift sets across food, drink, wellness, and entertainment categories. Popular offerings include cocktail mixer sets with recipe cards, global hot sauce collections for spice lovers, artisan chocolate samplers, cheese pairing kits, and cozy night-in bundles with tea and treats. Each set is designed around a specific experience — not just products to consume, but a moment to share. The packaging is polished and attractive, making each box feel like an event in itself.

## For Every Occasion

One of Thoughtfully's strengths is the breadth of its catalogue, which covers virtually every gifting occasion and recipient type. There are sets for birthdays, holidays, housewarmings, thank-yous, corporate gifts, and "just because" moments. The variety means there's something for the person who has everything — the friend who loves cooking, the colleague who's into craft cocktails, the parent who deserves a spa night. The price points range from accessible to premium, making thoughtful gifting available at every budget.

## Available in Canada

Thoughtfully sells through its online store and through major retailers, shipping across Canada. The brand has tapped into a growing preference for experience-based gifts over material ones, offering curated sets that feel generous and fun without requiring the giver to spend hours shopping. For Canadians who want to give gifts that create moments rather than clutter, Thoughtfully takes the guesswork out of the equation.
