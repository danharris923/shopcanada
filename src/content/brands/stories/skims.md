# SKIMS

SKIMS is a shapewear, underwear, and loungewear brand co-founded in June 2019 by Kim Kardashian, Jens Grede, and Emma Grede. Originally announced as Kimono Intimates, the brand was renamed to SKIMS in August 2019 after the mayor of Kyoto wrote to Kardashian asking her to reconsider. The launch on September 10, 2019 generated approximately $2 million in sales within minutes, selling out in ten minutes. SKIMS sold more than three million products in its first year and is now valued at $5 billion as of a November 2025 funding round led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives.

## Solutions for Every Body

SKIMS offers shapewear, underwear, bras, loungewear, clothing, swimwear, activewear, and a men's collection in sizes XXS to 5X, with shapewear available in nine-plus skin tone shades. Key collections include Fits Everybody, Cotton Collection, Soft Lounge, SKIMS Body, and Seamless Sculpt. The brand generated $750 million in revenue in 2023, a 50% year-over-year increase, with projected sales exceeding $1 billion by 2025. SKIMS operates 18 owned retail locations in the United States, with a three-story Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, a Sunset Strip flagship in Los Angeles, and international expansion into Dubai and London's Regent Street.

## Collaborations and Culture

SKIMS has built cultural momentum through high-profile partnerships: a Fendi collaboration that sold out in one minute, an official Team USA Olympic partnership, deals with the NBA and WNBA, and the NikeSKIMS joint venture launching training apparel and footwear. A North Face collaboration sold out in 20 minutes. The brand won the first-ever CFDA Innovation Award in 2022 and was named one of Time's Top 100 Most Influential Companies the same year. Harvard Business School produced a case study on SKIMS' meteoric rise.
