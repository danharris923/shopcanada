# Sleep Country

At Sleep Country, we believe we are all responsible for showing up as our best selves and to act in a way that’s respectful to one another and in line with our four core values: We CARE About People; We WIN Together; We DREAM Big; and We DELIVER with excellence.

These four key values exemplify our evolving culture and represent who we are, what we believe is important, how we want to show up in life, and what we think of in our work as we bring our purpose and vision to life every day.

They reflect our company's purpose—to transform lives by awakening Canadians to the power of sleep, and our vision—to champion sleep as the key to healthier, happier lives, and embody our thriving culture that is fundamental to our continued success.

Our values are what our organization stands for and are the beliefs and attitudes that guide us in everything we do. They build on our 28-year foundation of taking care of each other and our customers’ sleep needs, with passion and commitment to the best that we can be.
