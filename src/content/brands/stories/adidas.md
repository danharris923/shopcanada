## What Adidas Means to Canadian Shoppers

Adidas holds a distinctive position in Canadian retail as both a performance sportswear company and a lifestyle brand. The three-stripe logo appears equally in university gyms, professional sports venues, and downtown streetwear shops.

## Canadian Jobs & Operations

Adidas employs Canadians across retail stores, corporate functions, and distribution operations. The Brantford distribution centre represents a significant logistics operation, handling inventory and fulfilment for Canadian orders. The brand is the official apparel sponsor for the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association.

The free adiClub program offers free shipping on all orders, points on every purchase, and early access to sales. Students get 30% off regular prices and 15% off outlet items. Black Friday discounts reach up to 60% for members.
