# Canadian Heritage Roasting Co.

Canadian Heritage Roasting Co. is an Alberta-based coffee roaster founded by two former wildland firefighters who bonded over cups of percolated coffee brewed in the backcountry during fire season. Those long days fighting fires across Canada's wilderness — with nothing but the outdoors, hard work, and good coffee to keep spirits up — inspired a business built around bold flavours and a deep respect for the natural world. The company roasts in small batches, bringing the spirit of the Canadian backcountry into every bag.

## Small-Batch Roasting

Canadian Heritage Roasting Co. sources green coffee beans from quality growing regions and roasts them in small batches in Alberta. The roasting approach favours bold, full-bodied profiles that stand up to the rugged brand ethos — these are coffees meant for early mornings, campfire pots, and people who take their brew strong. The lineup includes single-origin offerings and signature blends, with roast levels ranging from medium to dark. Each batch is roasted to order or in limited quantities to ensure freshness.

## Rooted in the Outdoors

The brand's identity is inseparable from the Canadian wilderness. Packaging, naming, and marketing all reflect the founders' background in wildland firefighting and their love of the outdoors. The brand connects with Canadians who spend time in nature — hikers, campers, hunters, and anyone who appreciates the ritual of brewing a good cup of coffee in the bush. It's a brand that feels authentically Canadian, not because of maple leaf marketing, but because of the real experiences that shaped it.

## Supporting the Community

Canadian Heritage Roasting Co. sells through its online store and ships across Canada. The company has built a loyal following in the Alberta coffee community and among outdoor enthusiasts nationwide. The founders' background in public service carries through in the brand's ethos, connecting with customers who value hard work, the outdoors, and a genuinely good cup of coffee.
