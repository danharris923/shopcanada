# True Bijoux

True Bijoux is an Ottawa jewellery boutique that opened in 2006 as the sister store to Howard Fine Jewellers, one of Ottawa's longest-running jewellery businesses. Founded by Lindsay and Stephanie Appotive — known locally as the Jewelry Sisters — the boutique was created to offer a different kind of jewellery shopping experience: curated, personal, and focused on accessible luxury rather than the traditional fine jewellery showroom format.

## Curated Collections

True Bijoux carries a carefully curated selection of jewellery from Canadian and international designers, spanning fashion jewellery, demi-fine pieces, and select fine jewellery. The boutique stocks brands and designers that aren't typically found in malls or chain stores, giving customers access to unique pieces they won't see on everyone else. The Appotive sisters personally select every brand and piece carried in the store, drawing on their deep family background in the jewellery industry and their eye for emerging designers and trends.

## The Jewelry Sisters

Lindsay and Stephanie grew up in the jewellery business — Howard Fine Jewellers has been an Ottawa institution for decades — and they bring that inherited expertise to True Bijoux with a modern sensibility. Their approach emphasizes personal styling, helping customers find pieces that fit their individual style rather than pushing the most expensive option. The sisters are active in Ottawa's community and have built True Bijoux into a destination known as much for the shopping experience as for the jewellery itself.

## Ottawa's Jewellery Destination

True Bijoux operates from its Ottawa location and through its online store, shipping across Canada. The boutique has become a go-to for Ottawans shopping for gifts, bridal jewellery, or everyday accessories, offering a selection and experience that sits between big-box retailers and exclusive fine jewellers. For Canadian shoppers who want jewellery that's thoughtfully selected, personally styled, and backed by generations of industry knowledge, True Bijoux delivers a shopping experience that honours both tradition and modern taste.
