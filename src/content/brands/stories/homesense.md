# HomeSense

HomeSense launched in Canada in 2001 as the country's first home-focused off-price retailer, and it has since become one of the most popular destinations for Canadians furnishing and decorating their homes. Operated by TJX Companies — the same parent company behind Winners and Marshalls — HomeSense applies the off-price retail model specifically to home goods, offering brand-name furniture, decor, kitchenware, bedding, and housewares at prices significantly below traditional retail.

## The Treasure Hunt

Shopping at HomeSense is fundamentally different from shopping at a traditional home goods store. Inventory changes constantly as the company's buyers acquire overstock, closeouts, and special-make products from hundreds of brands and vendors worldwide. No two visits to the same store will yield the same selection, creating a "treasure hunt" experience where finding a great piece at an unexpected price is part of the appeal. The rotating inventory means customers learn to buy when they see something they love, because it likely won't be there next week.

## Brand Names, Better Prices

HomeSense carries products from well-known home brands — cookware, furniture, rugs, lighting, wall art, seasonal decor, and outdoor entertaining — at prices typically 20 to 60 percent below department store and specialty retailer pricing. The stores cover every room in the house, from kitchen gadgets and dinnerware to bedroom furniture and bathroom accessories. The quality ranges from affordable everyday items to genuine luxury pieces at fraction-of-retail prices.

## Across Canada

HomeSense operates stores in cities and suburbs across Canada, often located near Winners locations and sometimes sharing a combined store format. The chain has become a staple of Canadian home shopping, particularly among budget-conscious decorators and homeowners who enjoy the thrill of finding high-quality pieces at prices that make impulse buying feel responsible. For Canadians outfitting a new home or refreshing a room, HomeSense offers the possibility of designer-look results on a practical budget.
