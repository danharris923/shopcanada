# Ang Hill

Ang Hill is a Canadian fashion and lifestyle brand founded by Ang Johnson (formerly Hillaby) in Edmonton, Alberta. What started as a childhood dream grew into a clothing company built around comfort, confidence, and conscious design. The brand creates everyday apparel and accessories for women who want to look put-together without sacrificing how they feel — pieces you can wear from morning errands to evening plans without thinking twice.

## Effortless Everyday Style

The Ang Hill collection focuses on wardrobe staples that mix and match easily: relaxed-fit tops, comfortable dresses, layering pieces, and accessories that pull an outfit together. The designs lean into a casual-chic aesthetic that suits the realities of busy Canadian women's lives — clothes that look polished but move with you. Fabrics are chosen for softness, durability, and ease of care, and the colour palettes tend toward versatile neutrals and seasonal accent colours that work across a full wardrobe.

## Conscious Design

Ang is vocal about building a fashion brand that doesn't contribute to the disposable clothing cycle. The brand produces in smaller batches, focusing on quality over quantity, and selects materials with longevity in mind. Designs are intended to be worn season after season rather than discarded after a few washes. This approach means fewer styles released more thoughtfully, rather than the constant churn of fast fashion drops.

## Edmonton Roots

Based in Edmonton, Ang Hill sells primarily through its online store and ships across Canada. Ang Johnson has built the brand largely through social media, sharing the behind-the-scenes realities of running an independent fashion label and connecting personally with her customer base. For Canadian women who want to support independent, Canadian-designed clothing that prioritizes how you feel as much as how you look, Ang Hill offers a refreshing alternative to mass-market fashion.
