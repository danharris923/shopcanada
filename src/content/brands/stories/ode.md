# Ode

The beautiful journey of ÔDE started in 2015 in a small studio in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In 2020, the label relocated in Vancouver, Canada. Each piece has been consciously thought, designed and crafted. Comfort, aesthetic, protection and sustainability are the main priorities. Regarding fabrics: all laces come from France, more precisely from family lace makers in Calais-Caudry or Lyon. They have a real know-how and this for centuries. The quality and the fineness of the lace is one of the highest and it can last years. ÔDE wants to guarantee a non-harmful garment, so all the materials are certified Oeko-Tex. It is a label that guaranties non-harmful substances. And last but not least, production: All our pieces are proudly crafted in British Columbia, Canada. We cut and sew everything in our studio for capsule collections or we work with local atelier when the collections are bigger.
