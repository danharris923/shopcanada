# Mastermind Toys

Mastermind Toys is Canada's largest specialty toy retailer, founded in Toronto in 1984. For four decades, the company has focused on educational toys, games, puzzles, arts and crafts supplies, and activities that inspire creativity, learning, and imaginative play. In a toy market dominated by mass-market chains and licensed merchandise, Mastermind Toys has carved out a distinct position by curating products that parents and educators trust to be engaging, developmental, and worth the investment.

## Curated for Learning and Play

Mastermind Toys stocks a carefully selected range of toys and games chosen for their educational value, build quality, and ability to engage children's curiosity. The selection spans STEM toys, building sets, board games, art supplies, books, outdoor play equipment, and baby products. Staff are trained to make recommendations based on age, interest, and developmental stage, providing a level of expertise that big-box retailers don't offer. The stores are designed to be browsable and hands-on, encouraging kids and parents to discover new products together.

## More Than Toys R Us

Mastermind positioned itself as the thinking parent's toy store — the place you go when you want something more meaningful than the latest movie tie-in action figure. The product curation emphasizes brands known for quality and educational merit: LEGO, Playmobil, Melissa & Doug, Thames & Kosmos, and a rotating selection of independent and Canadian toy makers. The company also runs birthday party registries, loyalty programs, and seasonal events that make it a community hub for families.

## Growing Across Canada

Mastermind Toys operates retail locations across Ontario and other provinces, along with a full online store at mastermindtoys.com. The company has navigated shifts in the toy industry — including the closure of Toys R Us Canada — by staying true to its specialty retail model and the expertise that parents rely on. For Canadian families looking for toys that do more than make noise and end up in the donation bin, Mastermind Toys remains the destination that delivers quality, learning, and genuine play value.
