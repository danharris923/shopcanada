# Oak + Eve

Oak + Eve is a Canadian, woman-led accessories brand founded by Marisa, a mother of three who launched the company from a desire to create beautiful, well-crafted accessories that women genuinely love to wear every day. The brand designs and produces jewellery, hair accessories, and lifestyle products that balance timeless elegance with everyday practicality — pieces that are stylish enough for a night out but durable enough for the school run.

## The Collection

Oak + Eve's product range centres on accessories that elevate everyday outfits without requiring a major investment. The collection includes earrings, necklaces, bracelets, hair clips, and headbands, along with curated gift sets. The design aesthetic is modern and feminine — clean lines, warm metals, and organic shapes that complement a range of personal styles. Pieces are designed to be layered and mixed, encouraging customers to build looks that feel personal rather than prescribed.

## Craftsmanship and Quality

Despite accessible pricing, Oak + Eve prioritizes craftsmanship and quality materials. Jewellery pieces use hypoallergenic metals and durable finishes that resist tarnishing, addressing one of the most common complaints about affordable accessories. Hair accessories are designed to actually hold hair securely while looking beautiful — function and form in equal measure. The brand tests products in real-life conditions (including on Marisa's own three kids) to ensure they hold up to daily wear.

## Canadian Small Business

Oak + Eve sells primarily through its online store, shipping across Canada. The brand has built a community of loyal customers through social media, where Marisa shares styling inspiration, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the business, and the real-life balancing act of running a brand while raising a family. This authentic, personal approach to brand-building has resonated with Canadian women who want to support small businesses and wear accessories with a story behind them.
