# LOHN

LOHN is a Canadian candle and home fragrance brand founded by two chemical engineers in Vancouver, British Columbia, who channeled their scientific backgrounds into the art of scent. The brand creates clean-burning candles made from coconut and soy wax, infused with fragrances inspired by memories, places, and the ancient Amber Road — the historic trade routes that carried aromatic resins, spices, and perfumes between civilizations. The name "LOHN" means "reward" in German, reflecting the brand's belief that lighting a candle should feel like a small, earned luxury.

## The Science of Scent

The founders' engineering backgrounds show up in LOHN's approach to candle making. Every aspect of the product is carefully calibrated: the coconut-soy wax blend is chosen for its clean burn and superior scent throw, the cotton wicks are lead-free and self-trimming, and the fragrance oils are phthalate-free and formulated to release scent evenly throughout the candle's burn life. The result is a candle that burns cleanly without the soot, tunnelling, and uneven scent distribution that plague cheaper candles. Each candle is hand-poured in Vancouver.

## The Scent Collection

LOHN's fragrances are layered and evocative rather than single-note. Scent profiles draw on natural materials — amber, cedar, bergamot, fig, tobacco leaf, sage — creating complex combinations that evolve as the candle burns. The brand releases seasonal collections alongside permanent favourites, and the scent descriptions are written to evoke specific moods and memories rather than just listing ingredients. Beyond candles, LOHN has expanded into room sprays, incense, and other home fragrance products.

## Intentional Design

LOHN's packaging and vessel design are deliberately minimal — clean ceramic containers, understated labels, and earth-toned colours that are designed to complement any interior rather than compete with it. The brand sells through its online store and through select home goods boutiques and lifestyle retailers across Canada. LOHN has built a following among design-conscious Canadians who appreciate the intersection of science, craftsmanship, and aesthetic restraint.
