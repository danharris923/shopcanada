# Sundog Eyewear

Sundog Eyewear is a Canadian-designed sunglasses brand that has built its reputation in the sport and performance eyewear market. The company specializes in polarized sunglasses engineered for outdoor activities including golf, fishing, cycling, running, and winter sports. Sundog's approach combines advanced lens technology with sport-specific frame designs at price points well below premium brands like Oakley and Maui Jim, making quality polarized eyewear accessible to a broader range of Canadian athletes and outdoor enthusiasts.

## Lens Technology

Sundog's competitive advantage centres on its lens technology. The brand offers multiple lens tiers, including TrueBlue polarized lenses that filter blue light and reduce glare, and MELA-LENS technology designed to stimulate melatonin production by filtering specific light wavelengths. The polarized lenses are particularly valued by golfers and anglers, where glare reduction directly impacts performance — golfers can read greens better, and fishermen can see below the water's surface. All Sundog lenses provide 100% UV protection with optical-grade clarity.

## Sport-Specific Design

Rather than producing one-size-fits-all sunglasses, Sundog designs frames for specific activities. Golf frames are lightweight with non-slip temples that stay put during a swing. Fishing frames feature wrap-around designs that block peripheral light. Lifestyle frames offer a more casual aesthetic for everyday wear. The brand uses durable materials including TR-90 nylon frames that flex under pressure without breaking — a critical feature for active use. Rubberized nose pads and temple tips keep glasses secure during movement and sweating.

## Canadian Roots

Sundog Eyewear is designed in Canada and has maintained a particularly strong presence in the Canadian golf market, where the brand has been a fixture at pro shops and tournaments. The company sells through its online store, sporting goods retailers, and golf courses across the country. In a sunglasses market dominated by Italian conglomerates and luxury fashion brands, Sundog offers Canadian consumers performance-focused eyewear that prioritizes function and value over brand prestige.
