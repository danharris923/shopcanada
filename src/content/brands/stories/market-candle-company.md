THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING SMALL & LOCAL. MEET THE MAKERHI! I'M SHABI (LIKE NOT TOO SHABBY) FOUNDER & C. E. O OF MARKET CANDLE COMPANY. I HAVE A DEEP AND TRUE LOVE FOR THE COLOUR BLACK, ALL THINGS FOOD AND BEVERAGE, AND ANTHING WITH A HEAVY DOSE OF SARCASM.

I STARTED THIS COMPANY AS A SIDE HUSTLE TO KEEP ME ENTERTAINED IN THE EVENINGS, AND IT HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN I COULD EVER HAVE IMAGINED. WITH THE SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY, FRIENDS AND AMAZING CLIENTELE, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS MY CAREER AND FULL TIME PASSION PROJECT, AND I'M FOREVE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

I RECENTLY BECAME AN IVF MAMA TO A VERY SPECIAL LITTLE BOY, SO YOU WON'T ALWAYS SEE ME AT THE SHOP (HE'S ONLY A WEE BABE FOR A SHORT WHILE SO I'M CHOOSING TO SOAK IT ALL IN) BUT I'M ALWAYS WORKING HARD BEHIND THE SCENES.

THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY, SHOPPING LOCAL, AND SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS. YOUR SUPPORT ALLOWS ME TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I LOVE EVERY SINGLE DAY.
