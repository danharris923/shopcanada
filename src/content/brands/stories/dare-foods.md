# Dare Foods

Dare Foods was founded in 1892 by Charles Henry Dare in Kitchener, Ontario (then known as Berlin), starting as a small bakery producing cookies and crackers. Over more than 130 years, the family-owned company has grown into one of Canada's largest independently owned snack food manufacturers, producing cookies, crackers, candy, and snack products that are staples in Canadian pantries. The company remains privately held and continues to operate from its headquarters in Kitchener.

## The Brands

Dare's product portfolio includes several brands that Canadians know intimately. Bear Paws — the soft, bear-shaped cookies marketed to children — are one of the best-selling snack items in Canadian grocery stores. Breton crackers are a perennial entertaining staple, appearing on cheese boards across the country. Dare cookies include the Simple Pleasures line of premium cookies and traditional favourites like maple leaf cream cookies. The company also produces RealFruit gummies, Whippet marshmallow cookies, and a range of other sweet and savoury snacks.

## Canadian Manufacturing

Dare operates multiple manufacturing facilities in Ontario, producing the vast majority of its products domestically. The Kitchener headquarters houses both corporate offices and production lines, maintaining the connection between the company's roots and its current operations. The company employs over 1,300 people across its facilities. This Canadian manufacturing base allows Dare to control quality, respond quickly to market changes, and maintain the recipes and production standards that have kept customers loyal for generations.

## A Quiet Giant

Unlike flashier snack brands that spend heavily on advertising, Dare has built its business through product quality and retail relationships rather than massive marketing budgets. The company's products are available at virtually every grocery retailer in Canada and are exported to the United States and other markets. Dare is the kind of Canadian company that many people interact with daily without thinking about — the Bear Paws in the lunchbox, the Breton crackers at the dinner party — quietly dominant in the Canadian snack aisle.
