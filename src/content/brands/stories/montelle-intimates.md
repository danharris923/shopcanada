# Montelle Intimates

Montelle Intimates is a Canadian intimates brand founded in 1994 by William Haddad, designed at the company's Montreal headquarters and produced at a WRAP-certified, women-owned and managed factory in the Philippines that has been a manufacturing partner for over 20 years. The family-owned company celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2019 and has grown to serve over 400 retail accounts across fine lingerie boutiques in North America, Europe, and Asia. The team is 95% female — all designers, technical fit specialists, pattern-makers, seamstresses, and production staff are women, with only three men in the entire company.

## Fit and Craftsmanship

Montelle designs bras in band sizes 28 to 42 and cup sizes A to H, fitting every garment on live models in various shapes and sizes. The head fit technician brings over 35 years of experience to the process. The brand produces custom cups for every bra model and hand-drawn prints for its fabrics, releasing two fashion collections annually — Spring and Fall — alongside a year-round Essentials Collection of foundation pieces. The brand portfolio includes Montelle for bras and intimates, Fleur't for loungewear, HookedUp for shapewear, Miel for seamless innerwear, and Lusome for sleepwear with perspiration-managing textiles.

## Ethically Made

The manufacturing facility's wellness programs include Zumba classes, meditation breaks, and a healthy cafeteria, alongside strict social compliance standards and fair wages. Montelle donates regularly to breast cancer patient care, mentors girls in difficult socio-economic situations, and supports women's crisis shelters. The brand is committed to reducing plastic in its business-to-business packaging and shifting to sustainable fabrics.

## Canadian Intimates

Montelle has been featured in Forbes, Marie Claire, Glamour, InStyle, People, and Real Simple. Priced in the $34 to $79 range, the brand offers accessible quality for Canadians looking for well-made, ethically produced intimates designed in Montreal.
