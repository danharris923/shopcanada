# Shoppers Drug Mart

Murray Koffler opened the first Shoppers Drug Mart in 1962 in Toronto with a concept borrowed from American drugstore chains but adapted for the Canadian market. The key innovation was the "associate" ownership model: each store would be owned and operated by a licensed pharmacist who ran the business as their own while benefiting from the Shoppers Drug Mart brand, supply chain, and marketing. That model proved enormously successful. Today, Shoppers Drug Mart operates over 1,300 locations across Canada, making it the country's largest pharmacy chain.

## The Loblaw Acquisition

In 2014, Loblaw Companies Limited acquired Shoppers Drug Mart for approximately $12.4 billion, creating a retail powerhouse that combined Canada's largest grocery chain with its largest pharmacy chain. The merger brought Shoppers into the Loblaw family alongside Loblaws, No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, and Joe Fresh. One of the most visible results of the merger was the integration of the Shoppers Optimum loyalty program with PC Plus to create PC Optimum, now one of Canada's largest rewards programs.

## Beyond the Pharmacy Counter

While prescriptions remain the foundation of the business, Shoppers Drug Mart has evolved into a beauty and convenience destination. The Beauty Boutique sections within larger stores offer prestige cosmetics and skincare brands with trained beauty consultants. The company expanded into food retail, adding fresh and frozen food sections to many locations. Shoppers also provides healthcare services including flu shots, COVID vaccinations, medication reviews, and chronic disease management programs.

## A Canadian Fixture

Shoppers Drug Mart locations are a fixture of virtually every Canadian neighbourhood, from downtown cores to suburban strip malls to small-town main streets. The stores are typically open from early morning to midnight, and some locations operate 24 hours, serving as a reliable source for prescriptions, last-minute groceries, greeting cards, and household supplies. The company employs over 50,000 people across the country and has become as essential to the Canadian retail landscape as Tim Hortons is to the Canadian coffee scene.
