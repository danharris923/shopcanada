# Mother Earth Essentials

Our SToryWelcome to Mother Earth Essentials, founded by Carrie Armstrong, a Cree woman born and raised in Hinton, Alberta. She is a Registered Treaty Status card holder, connected to the disenfranchised Michel First Nation.

Rooted in the Belcourt and Calliou families, Carrie’s passion for the healing power of plants was inspired by her grandmother. With experience as an esthetician, cosmetic sales representative, and educator at Amiskwaciy Academy, Carrie created Mother Earth Essentials to celebrate the beauty and benefits of Canadian plants.
