# Enterprise

Jack Taylor founded Enterprise Rent-A-Car in 1957 in St. Louis, Missouri, with a fleet of just seven cars. He named the company after the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier, on which he served during World War II. Today, Enterprise Holdings is the largest car rental company in the world by fleet size and revenue, operating over 9,500 locations globally, including a significant network across Canada.

## The Neighbourhood Strategy

What distinguished Enterprise from competitors like Hertz and Avis was its decision to focus on neighbourhood locations rather than airports. While rivals fought for airport counter space, Enterprise set up shop in commercial strips, near auto dealerships, and in suburban areas where customers needed replacement vehicles while their own cars were being repaired. This "We'll Pick You Up" approach became the company's signature tagline and a genuine operational advantage. Enterprise eventually expanded into airports too, but the neighbourhood network remains its backbone.

## Enterprise in Canada

Enterprise has operated in Canada for decades, with locations in every province. The Canadian operation runs under enterprise.ca and offers the same range of services as the U.S. business: daily rentals, long-term leases, car sharing through Enterprise CarShare, and commercial fleet management. Canadian customers also have access to the Enterprise Plus loyalty program. The company's Canadian presence includes both corporate-owned locations and a strong relationship with insurance companies for replacement vehicle coverage.

## Still Family-Owned

Despite being one of the largest private companies in the world, with estimated annual revenues exceeding $30 billion USD, Enterprise Holdings remains controlled by the Taylor family. This private ownership has allowed Enterprise to invest in long-term growth without the pressure of public markets, contributing to a corporate culture that consistently ranks among the best places to work in the automotive and rental industry.
