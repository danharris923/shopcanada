# Lululemon

Chip Wilson founded lululemon athletica in Vancouver in 1998, opening the first standalone store on West 4th Avenue in Kitsilano in 2000. What began as a design studio by day and yoga studio by night has become one of the most valuable apparel companies in the world, with a market capitalization that has at times exceeded $50 billion.

## From Yoga Mat to Global Powerhouse

Wilson spotted the yoga trend early and saw that women practising yoga were wearing cotton clothing that didn't perform well during a sweaty class. He designed technical fabrics — most famously the Luon blend — that stretched, wicked moisture, and held their shape. The signature Groove Pant and later the Align Legging became cultural phenomena, worn far beyond yoga studios. Lululemon essentially created the "athleisure" category before the word existed.

## Vancouver Headquarters, Global Reach

Lululemon went public on NASDAQ in 2007 and now operates over 700 stores worldwide, with a significant concentration in Canada where the brand remains a point of national pride. The company's headquarters are still in Vancouver, employing thousands in design, technology, and operations. Annual revenue surpassed $9 billion in 2023. The brand expanded into menswear, footwear, and personal care products, and acquired the at-home fitness company Mirror in 2020.

## Community and Culture

Each lululemon store functions as a community hub, offering free yoga classes, run clubs, and meditation sessions led by local ambassadors — fitness instructors and athletes who represent the brand in their communities. This grassroots marketing approach has been central to building the kind of brand loyalty that keeps customers paying premium prices for leggings in a market flooded with cheaper alternatives.
