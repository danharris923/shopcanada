# Herschel Supply Co.

Herschel Supply Co. is a Canadian bag and accessories brand founded in 2009 by brothers Jamie and Lyndon Cormack in Vancouver, British Columbia. Named after the small town of Herschel, Saskatchewan, where three generations of the Cormack family grew up, the brand creates backpacks, duffel bags, luggage, and accessories with a design philosophy rooted in heritage, simplicity, and attention to detail. In just over a decade, Herschel has grown from a Vancouver startup into one of the world's most recognized bag brands.

## The Bags

Herschel is best known for its classic backpack silhouettes — the Little America and Heritage models in particular — which combine a vintage, timeless look with modern construction and materials. The product line extends to duffel bags, totes, hip packs, messenger bags, hardshell and softshell luggage, wallets, headwear, and apparel. Designs feature clean lines, quality zippers, and the brand's signature striped interior lining. The aesthetic hits a sweet spot between casual and polished, making Herschel bags appropriate for commuting, travelling, campus, and everyday use.

## Limited Lifetime Warranty

Herschel stands behind its products with a limited lifetime warranty, reflecting confidence in the construction quality. The brand uses durable fabrics, reinforced stitching, and quality hardware across its product lines. Collaborations with brands like LEGO, Liberty Fabrics, and various cultural partners keep the collection fresh while limited-edition releases create collector appeal. The Heritage Hardshell luggage line and Weather Resistant collection extend the brand into technical territory.

## Vancouver to the World

Herschel Supply Co. sells through its online store, its own retail locations, and thousands of retailers worldwide. The brand ships across Canada with free shipping on orders over $99. For Canadians who want a well-designed, durable bag from a proudly Canadian company that's taken the world by storm, Herschel Supply Co. delivers on its promise of thoughtful design at every price point.
