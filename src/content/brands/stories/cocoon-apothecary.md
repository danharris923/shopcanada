# Cocoon Apothecary

Our Story: 22 Years of Intentional Beauty Cocoon Apothecary began in 2003 with one belief: nature holds the intelligence our skin needs most. Since then, founder Jessica Burman has spent two decades studying aromatherapy, perfumery, and plant science to create skincare that’s luxurious, ethical, and deeply effective.

Where It All Began In 2003, a simple natural cream transformed a loved one’s skin and changed Jessica’s life. The following year, she earned her Aromatherapy Certification, studying how plant essences affect both skin and mood.

This was the true beginning of her formulating career — blending art, science, and a deep respect for the skin’s natural balance. Learning the Language of Scent To refine her craft, Jessica travelled to Provence to study at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery — the historic home of fine fragrance.

Among lavender fields and distilleries, she learned to compose scent with restraint, emotion, and respect for sensitive skin. These lessons shaped Cocoon’s signature aromatic identity: perfumes of purpose, not overpowering fragrance.

Mastering Plant Distillation Later, in Spokane, Washington, Jessica studied plant distillation under world-renowned distiller Ann Harman. Working hands-on with copper stills and fresh botanicals, she learned how to capture the purest expressions of plants.

That knowledge lives in every Cocoon formula — in the way our ingredients are chosen, extracted, and combined. Two Decades of Conscious Craftsmanship 2003Cocoon Apothecary is founded in Kitchener, Ontario.
