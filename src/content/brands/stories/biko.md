# Biko

About THE BRANDBIKO is a modern jewelry brand designed and handcrafted with love by a small team in Toronto, led by founder Corrine Anestopoulos. Inspired by nature, contemporary art, architecture and travel, BIKO is known for its high level of craftsmanship, luxe materials and timeless, sculptural aesthetic.

Since launching BIKO in 2005, Corrine has collaborated with retailers such as Nordstrom and Hudson's Bay Company, celebrities such as M. I. A. and Bianca Andreescu, and international corporations such as Mattel for Barbie's 60th Anniversary.

BIKO has graced the pages of Vogue, Rolling Stone, ELLE and InStyle, and remains focused on giving back through ongoing partnerships with charitable organizations, such as RETHINK Breast Cancer and Second Harvest.

BIKO is honoured to be nominated for the (CAFA) Canadian Arts & Fashion Accessory Designer of the Year Award for the last six consecutive award years - 2018, 2019, 2020/21 and 2022, 2023, and 2024. THE DESIGNERBorn and raised in Toronto, Corrine is inspired by contemporary design and exotic heirlooms from around the world.

Behind the brand for eighteen years, Corrine has become an inspirational entrepreneur, mentor and colleague to many creative businesses in North America. Corrine graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Design in Image Arts from Toronto Metropolitan University.

Her artistry marries symbolic design elements and a keen attention to detail with sleek mixed metals, hand-cast forms & natural stones, creating high-quality, versatile pieces that share a story. As Corrine continues to expand BIKO to retailers worldwide, she hopes to feed her love of the hunt for exciting new sources and inspiration by travelling often.

With every piece she creates, both modern and timeless, she looks forward to continuing to share her artistry and bring everyday beauty to her customers' lives.
