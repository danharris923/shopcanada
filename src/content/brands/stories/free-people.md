He opened a store and called it Free People. Free People nurtured the young people who lived there and shopped there, who looked for a little of their own freedom in the clothes they wore. As Dick's store grew from one to two, the name was changed from Free People to Urban Outfitters.

In time, his wife Meg came on to tend Urban's private label division, which supported product exclusive to Urban Outfitters. Demand was almost immediate and to meet this overwhelming need, she and Dick decided to create a wholesale line.

It was very well-received, so much so that Dick separated the businesses. For a while, the wholesale line took on many personalities: Bulldog, Ecote, Cooperative, Anthropologie, and then in 1984 a new life was breathed into the name Free People.

And that's us. During 2001, we realized that it was really Free People that invoked some of our favourite images, those of femininity, courage, and spirit. It was time to get back to our roots. Free People shed its junior image and evolved into a more mature, contemporary brand.

This allowed twenty-something women to appreciate the line of clothing that catered to their intelligence, creativity and individuality, while keeping with its great quality and affordability. And that's just who we wanted to reach: a 26-year-old girl, smart, creative, confident and comfortable in all aspects of her being, free and adventurous, sweet to tough to tomboy to romantic.
