# Penny Lane Organics

About Us HELLO I am Alexa Campbell, Owner of Penny Lane Organics, a Tree-Hugger and Skin Care Obsessed. I create a line of All Natural products based on my personal philosophy that if we wouldn’t put something IN our bodies then we won’t put it ON our bodies either. Our products are handmade in small batches to ensure high quality and freshness. We source luxurious organic ingredients that are all natural and rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Our products and ingredients are also cruelty-free, vegan/vegetarian, gluten free, sustainable and socially conscious. I believe all natural is best. If you have not made the switch now is the time. We offer Natural Skin Care, Personal Care, Baby Care, Pet Care, Aromatherapy and More. Handmade in Ontario, Canada with LOVE.
