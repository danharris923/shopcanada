# G Adventures

G Adventures is the world's largest small group adventure travel company, founded in 1990 by Bruce Poon Tip in Toronto. At 22 years old, Poon Tip launched the company with two maxed-out credit cards after a transformational backpacking trip through Asia, where he identified a gap between impersonal large group tours and going it completely alone. Today G Adventures operates 28 offices worldwide, employs over 2,200 people, and sends approximately 200,000 travellers on more than 750 tours across 100-plus countries on all seven continents each year.

## Changing the World Through Travel

G Adventures pioneered community tourism, building the company around the idea that travel should directly benefit the places it touches. The Planeterra Foundation, established in 2003, has supported over 80 community development projects globally. The company's Ripple Score measures what percentage of tour spending goes to local services, and programs like Trees for Days plants one tree per tour day. G Adventures was the first global travel company to achieve ChildSafe certification and has signed the Glasgow Declaration committing to halve its carbon footprint by 2030. Tour leaders, called Chief Experience Officers, guide small groups through experiences designed to connect travellers with local communities.

## Bruce Poon Tip

The founder's story is inseparable from the brand. Poon Tip was inducted into the Social Venture Network Hall of Fame in 2012, received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, won EY Entrepreneur of the Year three times, and was named a Glassdoor Top 10 CEO in 2019. His 2013 book Looptail became a New York Times bestseller and was the first business book endorsed by the Dalai Lama. G Adventures has been named one of Canada's 50 Best Managed Companies for over a decade.

## Adventure Travel for Canadians

G Adventures offers Canadians a homegrown alternative to international tour operators, with 100% guaranteed departures and tours spanning every style from classic group adventures to active expeditions, marine voyages, and rail journeys. The company's social enterprise model means every booking supports local communities, Indigenous peoples, and sustainable tourism practices worldwide.
