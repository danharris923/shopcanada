# Saltwinds Coffee Company

Saltwinds Coffee Company is an Atlantic Canadian coffee roaster based in Nova Scotia. The brand takes its name from the salt-laden winds that blow off the Atlantic Ocean across the Maritime provinces — a nod to the coastal landscape and culture that defines the region. Saltwinds sources specialty-grade green coffee beans from around the world and roasts them in small batches, producing coffees that reflect both the terroir of their origin and the character of the East Coast community that makes them.

## Small Batch Roasting

Saltwinds roasts in small batches to ensure freshness and consistency. The roasting profiles are developed to highlight the unique characteristics of each origin — bright acidity from Ethiopian beans, chocolate notes from Colombian, earthy depth from Sumatran. The brand offers a range that includes single-origin coffees, house blends, espresso roasts, and seasonal releases. Beans are roasted to order or on a frequent rotation, ensuring that customers receive coffee at peak freshness rather than bags that have been sitting on a shelf for months.

## Maritime Roots

The brand's identity is deeply tied to Atlantic Canada. Saltwinds captures the Maritime spirit — hardworking, genuine, community-oriented — in both its product and its approach to business. The company supports regional food systems and local suppliers, and participates in the East Coast's growing specialty coffee scene. The packaging and branding draw on Maritime imagery and language, creating a product that feels authentically East Coast rather than generically "craft."

## Online and Local

Saltwinds sells through its online store, shipping freshly roasted coffee across Canada, and through select retail partners in Atlantic Canada. The brand offers subscription programs for customers who want a regular delivery of fresh beans. For Canadians who want to support Atlantic Canadian business and enjoy specialty-grade coffee, Saltwinds provides a direct connection to the Maritime roasting community.
