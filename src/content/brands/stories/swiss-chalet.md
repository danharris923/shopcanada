# Swiss Chalet

Rick Mauran opened the first Swiss Chalet Barbecue Restaurant in Toronto in 1954, serving rotisserie chicken with a signature dipping sauce that would become one of the most debated condiments in Canadian food culture. Over seven decades later, Swiss Chalet operates more than 200 locations across Canada and remains the country's definitive rotisserie chicken restaurant.

## The Sauce

No conversation about Swiss Chalet is complete without mentioning the Chalet Sauce. The thin, savoury dipping sauce served alongside every order of rotisserie chicken has inspired fierce loyalty, countless copycat recipes, and genuine debate about what exactly is in it. Swiss Chalet has wisely kept the recipe a closely guarded secret, and the sauce is now sold in grocery stores across Canada for fans who want the experience at home. The quarter chicken dinner with fries, coleslaw, a bun, and that sauce remains the quintessential Swiss Chalet order.

## Part of the Recipe Unlimited Family

Swiss Chalet is owned by Recipe Unlimited Corporation (formerly Cara Operations), one of Canada's largest full-service restaurant companies. Recipe's portfolio includes Harvey's, Montana's, Kelsey's, East Side Mario's, The Keg, and several other brands. This corporate family provides Swiss Chalet with shared infrastructure and supply chain advantages while the brand maintains its own distinct identity and menu.

## A Canadian Comfort Food Institution

Swiss Chalet occupies a unique space in the Canadian restaurant landscape. It is not fast food, not fine dining, and not quite casual dining in the modern sense. It is its own category: a family restaurant where the menu has barely changed in decades because the core product does not need improving. The Festive Special, available during the holiday season with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and a slice of pie, has become an annual tradition for many Canadian families. Swiss Chalet also operates a robust delivery business, making it one of the earliest Canadian restaurant chains to embrace home delivery long before apps like Uber Eats existed.
