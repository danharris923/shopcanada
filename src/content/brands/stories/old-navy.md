# Old Navy

Old Navy is an American family clothing brand launched in 1994 as the value-priced arm of Gap Inc. The brand was designed to offer trendy, fun clothing at prices significantly below Gap and Banana Republic, making fashionable basics accessible to budget-conscious families. Old Navy quickly became one of the fastest-growing retailers in history and now operates a major Canadian presence with retail stores across the country and a dedicated Canadian e-commerce site.

## Affordable Family Fashion

Old Navy's strength is its ability to deliver on-trend clothing for the entire family — men, women, kids, baby, and maternity — at prices that make it feasible to refresh a wardrobe without financial stress. The brand is known for its denim, graphic tees, activewear, and seasonal collections that capture current trends in accessible, wearable formats. Old Navy leans into fun and colour more than its Gap Inc. siblings, with playful prints, bold collaborations, and frequent promotional events that create genuine excitement around affordable fashion.

## Value Without Compromise

Old Navy has positioned itself as the go-to for families who need to clothe growing kids, stock up on basics, and stay current without premium price tags. The brand runs aggressive promotional pricing — regular sales, loyalty rewards, and seasonal clearance events — that make already-affordable clothing even more accessible. Quality is calibrated to the price point: these are clothes designed to look great and hold up through a season of wear and washing, serving their purpose at a price that doesn't sting when kids outgrow them.

## Old Navy in Canada

Old Navy operates standalone stores and outlet locations across Canada, along with its Canadian e-commerce platform. The brand has become a go-to for Canadian families, particularly parents outfitting kids who seem to grow overnight. For Canadians who want to keep the household dressed in current styles without breaking the budget, Old Navy delivers fashion-forward family basics at prices that make sense.
