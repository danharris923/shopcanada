# Brooklinen

Brooklinen is an American bedding and home essentials brand founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 2014 by Rich and Vicki Fulop. The couple launched the company on Kickstarter with a simple premise: hotel-quality sheets and towels shouldn't cost a fortune. By cutting out retail middlemen and selling directly to consumers, Brooklinen delivers premium bedding made from the same materials used by luxury hotels at a fraction of the traditional retail price. The brand has since expanded into towels, robes, loungewear, and home accessories.

## Premium Bedding, Honest Prices

Brooklinen's core product line includes sheet sets in luxe sateen, classic percale, and lightweight linen — the three weave styles that cover virtually every sleeping preference. Sateen offers a silky, warm feel; percale delivers crisp, cool hotel-style sheets; linen provides breathable, lived-in softness that improves with washing. The brand also produces duvet covers, comforters, pillows, and mattress protectors, all made from premium materials sourced from quality manufacturers. Pricing is transparent and significantly below comparable products from department store bedding brands.

## Beyond the Bed

Brooklinen has expanded into bath (towels, bath mats, robes), loungewear (sweats, tees), and home accessories (candles, blankets). Each new category follows the same formula: identify a home essential that's overpriced at retail, source premium materials from quality manufacturers, and sell direct to consumer at a fair markup. The brand's towels, in particular, have earned the same reputation for quality-to-price ratio as the sheets that launched the company.

## Brooklinen for Canadians

Brooklinen ships to Canada, bringing its direct-to-consumer bedding and home products to Canadian shoppers. For Canadians who want their bed to feel like a luxury hotel without paying luxury prices, Brooklinen offers some of the best sheets, towels, and bedding available online — the kind of upgrade that makes a noticeable difference in daily comfort.
