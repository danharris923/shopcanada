# Stars & Strauss Menswear

Stars Men's Shops and Strauss Menswear are established Canadian menswear retailers that have been dressing Canadian men for formal occasions and professional life for decades. Operating primarily in Ontario, the stores specialize in suits, tuxedos, sport coats, dress shirts, and accessories — the kind of tailored menswear that department stores have largely abandoned and fast fashion brands don't do well. The combined operation serves as a destination for men who need to look sharp for weddings, business meetings, job interviews, and special events.

## The In-Store Experience

What distinguishes Stars & Strauss from online-only suit retailers is the personalized in-store experience. Staff provide one-on-one fitting consultations, helping customers select the right suit cut, fabric, and colour for their body type and occasion. On-site alterations ensure every garment fits properly — a critical factor with tailored clothing that online retailers struggle to replicate. The stores carry a range of price points, from affordable entry-level suits for young professionals to premium fabrics and designer labels for customers who demand the best.

## The Product Range

Beyond suits and tuxedos, Stars & Strauss carries a full menswear wardrobe: dress shirts, sport shirts, trousers, overcoats, shoes, ties, pocket squares, belts, cuff links, socks, scarves, and suspenders. The tuxedo rental program serves the wedding and prom markets, offering groomsmen packages and formal wear without the commitment of purchasing. The online store extends the brand's reach beyond its physical locations, making it possible for customers across Canada to shop the catalogue.

## Serving Canadian Men

Stars & Strauss has built its business on the understanding that many Canadian men find suit shopping intimidating or confusing, and that expert guidance makes the difference between a suit that looks adequate and one that looks exceptional. The stores serve a loyal customer base that returns for major life events — first job interviews, weddings, promotions — making the relationship between customer and retailer one that often spans years or even generations.
