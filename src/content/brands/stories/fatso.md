# Fatso

Fatso was created by a team of food lovers in Vancouver, British Columbia, who believed peanut butter could be more than just peanuts and salt. The brand launched with a line of high-fat peanut butters enhanced with MCT oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, and other functional fats designed to appeal to keto dieters, athletes, and anyone seeking a more nutritious nut butter. The name "Fatso" was a deliberate reclaiming of the word, reflecting the brand's message that healthy fats are something to embrace, not fear.

## The Product

Fatso's flagship product is its Classic Peanut Butter, which blends roasted peanuts with MCT oil (derived from coconut), organic coconut oil, avocado oil, chia seeds, flax seeds, and a touch of sea salt. The result is a peanut butter that's creamier and more nutrient-dense than conventional brands, with a higher fat content that aligns with ketogenic and low-carb eating patterns. The brand also offers flavoured varieties, including Maple and Crunchy Salted Caramel, all made without refined sugar, palm oil, or artificial additives.

## Clean Ingredients, Canadian Made

Every jar of Fatso is produced in Canada using non-GMO ingredients. The brand has built its reputation on a short, readable ingredient list — a sharp contrast to many commercial peanut butters that contain hydrogenated oils, icing sugar, and preservatives. Fatso uses no palm oil, which resonates with environmentally conscious consumers aware of palm oil's link to deforestation. The peanut butter is also gluten-free and vegan, making it accessible to a range of dietary preferences.

## Growing Presence

Fatso is available at natural food stores, grocery retailers, and online across Canada, and has expanded into the United States market. The brand has built a strong social media following and community around the idea that fat is fuel, not something to be avoided. In the crowded Canadian peanut butter market — dominated by legacy brands like Kraft and Skippy — Fatso has carved out space by offering a genuinely differentiated product backed by a clear nutritional philosophy.
