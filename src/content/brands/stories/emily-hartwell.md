# Emily Hartwell

ABOUT THE BRAND from the sea to the city Hi, I’m Emily Hartwell. I have spent most of my life pursuing the joy of art. I grew up in an artistic household. My dad is a gem carver, illustrator, and sculptor who has worked with jewellers for most of his career.

I always admired his studio, a sacred space he dedicated to making art. His drive to establish the life he wanted, full of creativity, inspired me to build a career supported by my art. Although my degree in fashion design at Blanche Macdonald was worthwhile, it didn’t involve much soldering and melting metal or any form of jewelry making.

However, it did inspire me to create art as a means of self-expression. Learning the ins and outs of the fashion world helped me understand how to structure the business side of my art. Being a self-taught jeweller means I don’t follow by-the-book techniques.

I like to think that makes the work I do more inherently me . I love that the realm of jewelry creation allows for so much space to learn. A new skill can open up a fresh era of design and creation. When I head to the beach, my artist’s eye notices more than just the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest landscapes of my home.

I am drawn to the lines of a shell, a rock's patterns, and a wave's curve. There is no truer beauty than that found in nature. We are part of that nature; what we create holds beauty, too. In a way, different from the ocean, cities are full of inspiration .

Growing up on a small island, I have a romantic notion of cities. I love the awe of a city like Paris that has stood the test of time for centuries. My work is just as home on a mountain trail as it is sipping espresso on a cobblestone street built hundreds of years ago.

If you ask any artist why we create, I am willing to bet they share my innate drive to do so. It’s not a question of why; it’s a question of when. It’s not a force that can be stopped; it’s in our blood, pouring out our fingertips no matter what materials we choose.

I am thankful that jewelry is where my drive has taken me. Creating wearable beauty creates so much joy that I know it sparks happiness in the person adorning it. I like creating something that lasts and passes its memories from wearer to wearer.

The sentimental quality inherent in a bespoke piece makes my connection with my work and customers much more meaningful. It’s like saying, “Here is a piece of my life that will become a piece of yours.

Care for it as I have; it will be with you forever. ” If you’ve followed along, you’ll notice I recently rebranded from my previous name (Hart & Stone) to Emily Hartwell. What started as a business idea over 10 years ago has grown into a passionate, creative endeavour.

I feel more connected to the business than ever. I wanted a name that reflected the hard work I have dedicated to growing the brand and myself, and what is more me than my name Welcome to Emily Hartwell.

This is me.
