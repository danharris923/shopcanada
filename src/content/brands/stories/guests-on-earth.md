# Guests on Earth

Guests on Earth is a Toronto-based company that makes plant-based, non-toxic cleaning products designed to be as beautiful as they are effective. Founded with the conviction that household cleaning doesn't have to involve harsh chemicals or ugly plastic bottles, the brand creates concentrated cleaning tablets, refillable glass bottles, and naturally derived formulas that turn a mundane chore into something closer to a self-care ritual. The name reflects the brand's environmental philosophy — we're guests on this planet, and we should clean up after ourselves without making a bigger mess.

## The Refill System

Guests on Earth's flagship innovation is its concentrated cleaning tablet system. Customers purchase a set of elegant glass spray bottles once, then drop in small, dissolvable cleaning tablets and add water to create all-purpose cleaner, glass cleaner, bathroom cleaner, and other formulas. This eliminates the need to buy new plastic spray bottles every time a cleaner runs out — a simple change that dramatically reduces plastic waste. The tablets are packaged in compostable wrappers, and each one replaces one full bottle of conventional cleaner.

## Plant-Based Formulas

The cleaning formulas are plant-derived, biodegradable, and free from bleach, ammonia, phosphates, synthetic fragrances, and dyes. Despite the gentle ingredient list, the products are designed to actually clean — the brand backs up its formulas with efficacy testing. Scents come from essential oils and natural extracts rather than synthetic fragrance chemicals. The product line has expanded to include dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap, and specialty cleaners, all following the same principles of natural ingredients and minimal packaging waste.

## Counter-Worthy Design

The glass bottles and minimalist packaging are deliberately designed to sit on a kitchen counter or bathroom shelf without looking like cleaning products. This aesthetic approach isn't just vanity — it encourages people to keep cleaners accessible and use them more regularly. The brand sells through its online store and through select home goods retailers across Canada, appealing to design-conscious consumers who want their cleaning products to match the intentionality they bring to the rest of their home.
