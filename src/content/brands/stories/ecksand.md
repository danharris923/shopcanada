About sustainability Ecksand Difference Customer Service Press Blog Contact About Ecksand Canadian Jewelers Ecksand is a brand rooted in values - built on a deep respect for our artisans, materials, and community. Founded in 2009, we've remained fully vertical, crafting every piece by hand in our Montreal atelier. This approach isn't just rare - it's now officially recognized by the Canadian National Mark, a distinction that verifies our jewelry is made entirely in Canada and meets the highest standards of ethical craftsmanship. The Montreal, Canada Atelier At the core of Ecksand's operations is our state-of-the-art workshop in Montreal, Canada. Here, our skilled artisans bring each design to life entirely by hand, ensuring that every detail meets our exacting standards. This vertical integration, from design conception to final polish, allows us to maintain complete quality assurance at every stage of production. Designed with productivity and purpose in mind, our atelier fosters a safe and pleasant working environment. We prioritize environmental responsibility by filtering used water before it returns to the Earth, and capturing all volatile polishing compounds with specially engineered vacuum systems. By controlling the entire manufacturing process, we guarantee that each piece not only reflects our commitment to sustainability but also embodies the unique artistry that sets Ecksand apart. learn more about the ecksand atelier Certified Canadian Craftsmanship Ecksand has been awarded the Canadian National Mark—an official designation granted by the Commissioner of Competition.
