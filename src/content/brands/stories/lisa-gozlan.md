# Lisa Gozlan

Lisa Gozlan is a Canadian jewellery brand created by husband-and-wife team Lisa and Ryan Gozlan. Lisa brings a background as a professional stylist with an eye for how jewellery completes an outfit and communicates personal style. Ryan is a fifth-generation jeweller whose family has been in the trade for over a century, bringing deep technical knowledge of metalwork, stone setting, and jewellery construction. Together, they've built a brand that merges fashion-forward design with old-world craftsmanship.

## Fashion Meets Fine Jewellery

The Lisa Gozlan collection sits at the intersection of fashion jewellery and fine jewellery — pieces that have the design sensibility of runway accessories but are made with the materials and construction standards of traditional fine jewellery. The line includes statement earrings, layering necklaces, cocktail rings, and bracelets crafted from gold, sterling silver, and semi-precious stones. Lisa's styling background ensures every piece is designed with outfit context in mind — how it catches light, how it layers, how it photographs.

## Five Generations of Craft

Ryan's family heritage in jewellery making isn't just a backstory — it informs how every piece is constructed. The brand combines traditional bench jewellery techniques with modern design, resulting in pieces that are built to last rather than designed for a season. Quality control reflects five generations of standards: secure settings, durable clasps, and finishes that maintain their appearance through daily wear. The couple's complementary skills — her eye for trends and styling, his mastery of the craft — create a brand that delivers on both aesthetics and substance.

## Canadian Made

Lisa Gozlan sells through its online store and select retailers across Canada. The brand appeals to Canadian women who want jewellery that's fashion-forward but built with integrity — pieces that make a statement today and still look beautiful years from now. For customers who value both design and craftsmanship, Lisa Gozlan offers the rare combination of a stylist's eye and a master jeweller's hand.
