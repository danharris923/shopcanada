# Hot Mamas

Hot Mamas is a Canadian, family-run food company based in Nova Scotia that specializes in bold, Caribbean-inspired hot sauces, marinades, jerk seasonings, and condiments. The brand was founded by a family with Caribbean roots who wanted to bring authentic island flavours to Canadian kitchens. What started as a small-batch operation making sauces from family recipes has grown into a nationally distributed brand found on grocery shelves across the country.

## Caribbean Heat, Canadian Made

Hot Mamas' product line draws heavily from Caribbean culinary traditions, featuring scotch bonnet peppers, jerk spice blends, and tropical fruit-based sauces that deliver genuine heat with complex flavour profiles. The flagship hot sauces range from mild to extremely spicy, using real peppers rather than extract-based heat that characterizes many mass-produced hot sauces. The jerk marinades and seasonings are designed to be versatile — equally effective on chicken, pork, fish, or grilled vegetables. All products are made in Canada.

## The Product Range

Beyond hot sauces, Hot Mamas produces jerk pastes, pepper jellies, marinades, and dipping sauces. The pepper jelly, made with real fruit and scotch bonnet peppers, has become a particular favourite for cheese boards and appetizers. The brand also offers milder options for families and heat-sensitive palates, ensuring the Caribbean flavour experience is accessible to everyone. Recipes are developed in-house using traditional techniques and ingredients, maintaining the authenticity that sets Hot Mamas apart from generic hot sauce brands.

## From Nova Scotia to National Shelves

Hot Mamas products are available at major Canadian grocery retailers and specialty food stores, as well as through the brand's online shop. The company has grown steadily through a combination of food show appearances, sampling events, and word-of-mouth recommendations from loyal customers. In the booming Canadian hot sauce market — which has exploded alongside the broader cultural embrace of spicy food — Hot Mamas stands out by offering sauces rooted in genuine Caribbean culinary tradition rather than novelty-driven heat.
