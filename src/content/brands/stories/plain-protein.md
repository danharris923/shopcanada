# Plain Nutrition

Plain Nutrition (formerly Plain Protein) is a Canadian supplement brand that strips sports nutrition down to its essentials. The company's philosophy is that effective supplements don't need artificial flavours, sweeteners, colours, or fillers — just the active ingredients in their purest form. This no-nonsense approach appeals to consumers who are skeptical of the supplement industry's tendency to hide mediocre products behind proprietary blends and flashy marketing.

## The Minimalist Approach

Plain Nutrition's product line is built around single-ingredient and minimally formulated supplements. The protein powders contain whey protein and nothing else — no sucralose, no artificial flavouring, no lecithin. Customers who want flavour can add their own using fruits, cocoa powder, or whatever they prefer, giving them complete control over what goes into their shake. This approach extends across the product range, which includes creatine monohydrate, collagen peptides, and other staples, each sold in its simplest effective form.

## Canadian Operations

The company operates out of Canada and manufactures its products domestically, ensuring compliance with Health Canada's regulations for natural health products. The packaging is deliberately minimal — plain bags with clean typography and nothing more — reflecting the brand's rejection of the hype-driven aesthetics common in the supplement industry. The pricing is competitive because there's no money spent on expensive flavouring systems, artificial colouring, or elaborate packaging design.

## For the Informed Consumer

Plain Nutrition has found its audience among consumers who read ingredient labels carefully and prefer to know exactly what they're putting in their bodies. Fitness enthusiasts, athletes, and health-conscious individuals who have grown tired of "proprietary blend" labels and 30-ingredient protein powders have gravitated toward the brand. The company sells direct through its website, keeping distribution simple and costs low while building a loyal customer base that values substance over style.
