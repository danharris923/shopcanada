# Supergoop!

Supergoop! is an American sunscreen and SPF brand founded in 2005 by Holly Thaggard in San Antonio, Texas. The brand was created with a single mission: change the way people think about sunscreen by making SPF products that are so pleasant to wear, you'll actually use them every day. Thaggard was inspired to start the company after a close friend was diagnosed with skin cancer, and she realized that most people skip sunscreen not because they don't know it's important, but because traditional sunscreens are greasy, white-casty, and unpleasant to wear.

## SPF You'll Actually Wear

Supergoop! has pioneered over 40 different SPF formulations, each designed for a specific step in a beauty or skincare routine. The Unseen Sunscreen is the brand's hero product — a totally invisible, weightless SPF 40 that doubles as a makeup primer. The Glowscreen adds a dewy finish, the PLAY line covers body and outdoor activities, and the Protec(tive) Daily Moisturizer combines SPF with skincare benefits. Every product is formulated to feel like skincare or makeup rather than sunscreen, eliminating the reasons people typically skip sun protection.

## Beyond the Beach

Supergoop!'s core innovation was reframing sunscreen as a daily skincare essential rather than a beach product. The brand educates consumers that UV damage happens year-round — on cloudy days, through car windows, from screen light — and that daily SPF is the single most effective anti-aging product you can use. This messaging, combined with products that genuinely feel good to wear, has helped shift consumer behaviour toward daily sunscreen use.

## Supergoop! in Canada

Supergoop! ships to Canada and is available at Sephora stores and online across the country. The brand has become a staple in Canadian skincare routines, particularly as awareness of year-round UV exposure grows — even during grey Canadian winters. For Canadians who want to protect their skin every day without adding a heavy, greasy step to their routine, Supergoop! makes sun protection something you'll look forward to rather than dread.
