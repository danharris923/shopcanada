# Article Furniture Content

## Deal Page Content Block (300-500 words)

Article is a direct-to-consumer furniture brand founded in Vancouver in 2011 by four software engineers who saw an opportunity to simplify how Canadians buy mid-century modern furniture. By eliminating traditional retail markups and selling exclusively online, the company offers contemporary sofas, chairs, tables, and bedroom furniture at prices typically 20-30% lower than conventional furniture stores.

Canadian shoppers choose Article for its curated selection of modern furniture that ships across the country, including to less populated regions outside major cities. The company operates from its Vancouver headquarters on Raymur Avenue and maintains warehouses in the United States to serve both Canadian and American customers. While shipping to remote areas like Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut incurs additional fees calculated at checkout, orders over $999 qualify for free delivery within standard service zones.

The direct-to-consumer model means Article controls product design, manufacturing partnerships, and delivery logistics. This allows for competitive pricing on pieces that typically feature solid wood frames, durable upholstery, and mid-century or Scandinavian-inspired designs. The company offers a one-year manufacturer's warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Returns are accepted within 30 days of delivery, though customers should expect a $49 return shipping fee for most items and a $50 repackaging fee if the original packaging has been discarded. The first exchange within this period is free for customers in standard service areas. Article also offers a price adjustment policy: if an item goes on sale within 30 days of purchase, customers can request a one-time price match to the current sale price.

Sales cycles follow predictable patterns. The deepest discounts appear during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with savings ranging from 25-50% across most categories. Labor Day sales typically focus on outdoor furniture with discounts of 20-40%, while January clearance events help make room for new inventory. Article doesn't regularly distribute discount codes through third-party coupon sites, but customers who sign up for the email newsletter receive early access to sales and occasional promotional offers.

In-room delivery and assembly services are available for an additional fee. The company also partners with Affirm to offer financing options for larger purchases, making it easier for Canadians to spread payments over time.

### What This Brand Means to Canadian Shoppers

Article represents a Vancouver-born response to the traditional furniture retail experience. For Canadians shopping for modern furniture, the brand offers an alternative to showroom visits and multi-week delivery timelines. The company's website showcases each piece with detailed dimensions, multiple angles, and customer photos, allowing shoppers to make informed decisions from home. Article's direct-to-consumer approach has resonated particularly well with urban Canadians furnishing condos and apartments, where mid-century modern aesthetics and space-efficient designs align with both lifestyle preferences and practical needs.

The brand's Canadian roots remain visible in its Vancouver headquarters, though its customer base now spans North America. For shoppers in Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, and other major cities, Article delivers assembled or flat-pack furniture without requiring visits to warehouse showrooms. The trade-off is minimal: shoppers give up the ability to test furniture in person but gain access to designer-quality pieces at prices that undercut traditional retailers by removing intermediary costs.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

Four software engineers—Aamir Baig, Fraser Hall, and brothers Sam and Andy Prochazka—founded Article in Vancouver in 2011 under the original name Bryght Furniture. None had worked in the furniture industry before. They launched the first website in 2013, focusing on mid-century modern and Scandinavian-inspired furniture sold directly to consumers in Canada and the United States.

The company rebranded to Article in 2016 after resolving a trademark issue with Bright Furniture in New York. By 2017, Article had grown to $100 million USD in annual revenue. That same year, the company relocated from 5,000 square feet to a 115,000-square-foot headquarters in Vancouver's Strathcona neighbourhood. Employee count jumped from 40 at the end of 2016 to 150 by the end of 2017, with over 100 based at the Vancouver headquarters.

Article ranked number one on Canadian Business's Growth 500 list in both 2018 and 2019, earning recognition as Canada's fastest-growing company for two consecutive years. The company has remained profitable since 2015 and continues to operate without external venture capital, maintaining founder control over business decisions. Article opened its first physical retail location in Vancouver in recent years, though the company's primary sales channel remains its website.

### Why Canadians Choose This Brand

Canadian shoppers gravitate toward Article for several practical reasons. The furniture arrives faster than custom orders from traditional retailers, typically within two to four weeks depending on location and product availability. The aesthetic is consistent: clean lines, tapered legs, button tufting, and neutral fabric tones that suit contemporary apartments and houses without skewing too trendy or disposable.

Pricing sits in the mid-range. A three-seat sofa might cost between $1,200 and $2,500, positioned above big-box retailers like IKEA but below luxury showroom brands. For Canadians furnishing entire rooms, this pricing structure makes it possible to outfit a living room or bedroom without exceeding typical furniture budgets.

Article's product photography and customer review system help reduce uncertainty. Each listing includes measurements, fabric swatches available by mail, and photos submitted by customers in real homes. This transparency matters when buying furniture sight unseen. The company also provides detailed care guides and assembly instructions for items that require setup.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

Article does not operate a traditional rewards program or membership tier system. Pricing remains straightforward: listed prices reflect the cost, with promotions appearing during scheduled sale events rather than through ongoing points accumulation or member discounts.

The most reliable way to access lower prices is timing purchases around major sales. Black Friday and Cyber Monday consistently deliver the deepest discounts, with savings of 25-50% across most furniture categories. Labor Day sales focus primarily on outdoor furniture, with discounts ranging from 20-40%. January clearance events help move inventory before new collections arrive.

Article occasionally offers promotional codes through its email newsletter, though these are less common than seasonal site-wide sales. Third-party coupon websites often list expired or fraudulent codes that Article cannot honor. Shoppers looking for legitimate discounts should sign up for the official newsletter or monitor the website during known sale periods.

The company's price adjustment policy offers some flexibility: if an item purchased at full price goes on sale within 30 days, customers can request a one-time price match to reflect the reduced cost. This policy protects against the frustration of buying just before a major sale.

Financing through Affirm allows Canadians to split larger purchases into monthly payments, though interest rates and approval criteria are set by Affirm rather than Article.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

Article's [return policy](https://www.article.com/help-center/returns) allows customers to return furniture within 30 days of delivery, provided items remain in as-new condition. Returns incur a $49 shipping fee for most pieces and $19 for smaller items. If the original packaging has been discarded, an additional $50 repackaging fee applies. For customers outside standard service areas, return fees match the original forward shipping cost.

Exchanges work differently: the first exchange within 30 days is free for customers in standard service zones. Subsequent exchanges require payment of shipping fees. For remote locations, Article waives the return shipping fee but charges a forward shipping fee for the replacement item.

Custom and personalized items follow the same 30-day return window, an uncommon policy in the furniture industry where custom orders are typically final sale.

The one-year manufacturer's warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship from the delivery date. If furniture shows manufacturing defects, Article will arrange replacement parts, repairs, or complete replacements. The warranty excludes damage from misuse, accidents, commercial use, modifications, or excessive wear and tear.

Customer service operates primarily through email and chat support. Response times and service quality vary based on customer reviews, with some shoppers praising quick resolutions while others report delays during peak periods.

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

Article ships to all Canadian provinces and territories, though delivery fees vary by location. Orders over $999 qualify for free delivery within standard service areas, which include major cities and surrounding suburbs. Less populated regions like Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and rural areas outside major metropolitan zones face additional shipping fees displayed during checkout.

Standard delivery brings furniture to the front door or building entrance. For $119, the In-Room Delivery service places furniture in a specified room, with delivery personnel wearing shoe covers to protect floors. Assembly service is available for an additional fee, useful for larger pieces or customers without tools.

Delivery timelines depend on product availability and destination. In-stock items typically arrive within two to four weeks. Custom or made-to-order pieces may require six to eight weeks. Article provides tracking information once orders ship, allowing customers to monitor progress and plan for delivery windows.

The company's [shipping policies](https://www.article.com/help-center/delivery) outline specific details for different regions and furniture types. Larger items like sectional sofas may require freight delivery, which involves scheduling a delivery window with a logistics partner.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

Article's Vancouver headquarters employs hundreds of Canadians across product development, photography, customer service, marketing, logistics coordination, and software engineering. The company expanded its headquarters to 115,000 square feet in 2017 to accommodate growth, maintaining its presence in Vancouver's Strathcona neighbourhood.

The founders' backgrounds in software engineering influence the company's approach to operations. Article builds proprietary systems for inventory management, customer service workflows, and website functionality. These technical roles are primarily based in Vancouver, though the company also operates an Asia headquarters in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where manufacturing partnerships are coordinated.

Article operates warehouses in Seattle, Los Angeles, New Jersey, and Jacksonville to serve the North American market. While these facilities are located in the United States, they support the logistics network that delivers furniture to Canadian customers. The company has also developed an in-house delivery program in Canada, reducing reliance on third-party carriers for last-mile delivery in major markets.

Employee reviews on platforms like Glassdoor show mixed sentiments, with ratings averaging 3.5 out of 5 stars. The company operates on a hybrid work model, with Vancouver-based employees working in the office three days per week.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

The most effective strategy for saving money at Article involves planning purchases around predictable sale cycles. Black Friday and Cyber Monday represent the year's largest discounts, typically spanning several days rather than just the named holidays. Discounts during this period range from 25-50%, covering most furniture categories including sofas, beds, dining tables, and outdoor pieces.

Labor Day sales focus on outdoor furniture as the summer season ends, with discounts between 20-40% on patio sets, lounge chairs, and outdoor dining furniture. January clearance events make room for new inventory, offering deep discounts on select pieces that may be discontinued or overstocked.

Email subscribers receive early access to sales, sometimes gaining 24-48 hours before promotions go public. This advance notice can be useful when popular items sell out quickly during major sales.

The price adjustment policy provides a safety net: if an item goes on sale within 30 days of purchase, requesting a price match ensures customers don't pay more than necessary. This policy works particularly well for shoppers who purchase in the weeks leading up to known sale periods.

Financing through Affirm spreads costs over time, though shoppers should evaluate interest rates carefully. Zero-interest promotional periods occasionally appear during major sales, making financing more attractive for larger purchases.

### Why This Brand Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

Despite now serving customers across North America, Article's founding in Vancouver and continued headquarters presence make it relevant to Canadian shoppers seeking domestically grown brands. The company's growth from a startup founded by four engineers to one of Canada's fastest-growing companies demonstrates the strength of Canadian entrepreneurship in disrupting traditional retail models.

For Canadians, Article offers a meaningful alternative to imported furniture from the United States or Europe. While manufacturing happens overseas—primarily in Vietnam and China—product design, photography, marketing, and customer service coordination occur in Vancouver. This structure provides Canadian jobs while keeping retail prices competitive.

Article's approach to furniture retail aligns with broader shifts in Canadian consumer behavior: preference for online shopping, desire for transparent pricing, and interest in mid-century modern aesthetics. The brand's success reflects these trends while maintaining a business model that serves both Canadian and American markets from its Vancouver base.

Canadian shoppers benefit from a company that understands domestic shipping challenges, currency considerations, and regional aesthetic preferences. Article's continued growth suggests the direct-to-consumer furniture model resonates particularly well in Canada, where geographic distances and retail consolidation make alternative shopping channels valuable.
