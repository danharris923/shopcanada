Canada Computers has been serving Canadian tech enthusiasts and PC builders since 1991, when founder Gordon Chan started selling computer parts to university students in Kingston, Ontario. Today, the company operates over 35 stores across Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, with headquarters in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

The retailer specializes in computer components, pre-built systems, laptops, peripherals, and consumer electronics. Canadian shoppers often turn to Canada Computers for PC building projects, with stores stocking processors, graphics cards, motherboards, RAM, storage drives, and cooling solutions from major manufacturers. The company also offers custom PC building services through in-store consultations, where technicians handle component assembly, cable management, testing, and even custom liquid cooling installations.

Canada Computers runs a member deals program that provides exclusive pricing on select products. Members can access discounted rates on components, laptops, monitors, and gaming peripherals without paying annual membership fees. The company also operates service and repair centers at many locations, offering diagnostics and warranty support.

Returns follow a 15-day window for most products, with 30-day defective exchanges available on standard items. Computer components like processors, RAM, and SSDs qualify for 15-day returns but extend to 90-day defective exchanges. Laptops and tablets also receive the extended 90-day defective exchange period. Products must be returned in original, resalable condition with complete packaging and accessories. Items used for cryptocurrency mining are explicitly excluded from return and warranty coverage. Full details are available on the [returns and exchanges policy page](https://www.canadacomputers.com/policies-returns-exchanges.php).

The company ships across Canada and offers in-store pickup at any location. Online orders can be tracked through customer accounts, and many items are available for same-day pickup when ordered before store closing times. Shipping costs vary by product and destination, with free shipping promotions appearing regularly on higher-value orders.

Sale events typically align with back-to-school season, Black Friday, Boxing Day, and periodic component clearances. The company also runs weekly deals on CPUs, GPUs, and other high-demand parts, which are promoted through email newsletters and social media channels.

### What Canada Computers Means to Canadian Shoppers

Canada Computers occupies a distinct position in the Canadian tech retail landscape as a homegrown alternative to international electronics chains. For PC builders, gamers, and IT professionals, the retailer provides access to computer components and hardware that might otherwise require ordering from U.S.-based suppliers with added duties and brokerage fees. The company's store network across four provinces gives Canadian shoppers local access to technical staff who understand system building, component compatibility, and performance optimization.

The retailer's 35-plus locations serve as both retail stores and technical service centers, handling warranty claims, repairs, and custom build consultations. This combination of product selection and hands-on service makes the company particularly relevant for customers who prefer in-person assistance when assembling systems or troubleshooting hardware issues.

### Brand History and Entry Into Canada

Gordon Chan founded Canada Computers in 1991 while studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He initially sold floppy discs and computer parts to fellow students at prices accessible to the university community. Using early profits, Chan expanded into printers and additional components, eventually opening the first dedicated Canada Computers retail location in Kingston in 1992.

The company grew steadily through the 1990s and 2000s, focusing primarily on Ontario markets where demand for PC components remained strong among students, gamers, and small businesses. By 2020, Canada Computers had established 37 store locations: 26 in Ontario, five in British Columbia, five in Quebec, and one in Nova Scotia. The Halifax location marked the company's first expansion into Atlantic Canada, signaling an intention to serve markets that historically had limited access to dedicated computer component retailers.

Today, Canada Computers remains privately owned and operated, employing over 1,000 Canadians across retail, service, logistics, and administrative roles. The company's headquarters in Richmond Hill, Ontario oversees operations, online sales, and distribution.

### Why Canadians Choose Canada Computers

Canadian shoppers often select Canada Computers when building or upgrading desktop PCs, as the company stocks individual components rather than only selling pre-configured systems. This approach appeals to enthusiasts who want control over hardware selection, performance specifications, and budget allocation. Stores typically carry multiple options for processors, motherboards, graphics cards, power supplies, and cases, allowing customers to compare brands and specifications in person.

The company's service centers provide another draw. Rather than shipping defective components back to manufacturers, customers can bring items to local stores for testing and warranty processing. This speeds up replacements and eliminates uncertainty about which component is causing system failures. Technicians at service centers can diagnose issues, verify defects, and initiate manufacturer warranty claims on behalf of customers.

For those who prefer to have systems built professionally, Canada Computers offers assembly services. Customers can select components online or in-store, then pay for technician assembly that includes cable management, BIOS configuration, and system testing. The company also provides custom liquid cooling installation for performance enthusiasts seeking advanced thermal management.

### Pricing, Rewards, and Membership Programs

Canada Computers operates a member deals program that grants access to exclusive pricing on select products. Membership is free, with no annual fees or purchase minimums. Members receive promotional emails highlighting weekly deals, component price drops, and clearance events. Discounts typically apply to CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, storage drives, monitors, and gaming peripherals.

The company does not offer a formal price-match guarantee, though staff may accommodate pricing requests on a case-by-case basis. Instead, the retailer focuses on competitive baseline pricing for components, particularly during sale events.

Seasonal promotions align with Black Friday, Boxing Day, and back-to-school periods, when the company discounts laptops, pre-built systems, monitors, and peripherals. Component sales occur more frequently, with weekly deals rotating through different product categories. Customers who sign up for email newsletters receive advance notice of these promotions.

### Returns, Warranties, and Customer Experience

Canada Computers provides 15-day returns and 30-day defective exchanges on most products from the invoice date. However, computer components like processors, RAM, SSDs, and graphics cards qualify for 15-day returns with 90-day defective exchanges. Laptops and tablets also receive the extended 90-day defective exchange period. Full policy details are outlined on the company's [returns and exchanges page](https://www.canadacomputers.com/policies-returns-exchanges.php).

Returns require original packaging, accessories, manuals, and proof of purchase. Products must be in resalable condition without physical damage. The company refunds to the original payment method but excludes shipping and handling fees from refund amounts.

Certain items are non-returnable, including printers with opened ink cartridges, custom-built systems, cable modems, digital downloads, software keys, gift cards, and products used for cryptocurrency mining. This last exclusion reflects the excessive wear that mining operations place on components, particularly graphics cards and power supplies.

The company offers [manufacturer warranty support](https://www.canadacomputers.com/en/manufacturer-warranty) for products beyond the return period. Within the first year from purchase, Canada Computers ships defective products to manufacturers for repair or replacement at no cost to customers. After the first year, the company offers to ship defective items to manufacturers for a minimal fee.

### Online Shopping and Canadian Shipping

Canada Computers ships across Canada through partnerships with national carriers. The company's website allows customers to browse inventory, check stock levels at specific store locations, and place orders for home delivery or in-store pickup. Many products qualify for same-day pickup when ordered before store closing times, which is particularly useful for urgent component replacements or time-sensitive builds.

Shipping costs vary by product weight, dimensions, and destination. The company periodically runs free shipping promotions on orders above certain dollar thresholds, typically advertised on the homepage and through member emails. Rural customers can receive deliveries through Canada Post, though transit times may extend beyond urban delivery schedules.

The website includes order tracking tools that let customers monitor shipment status and estimated delivery dates. Customer accounts store purchase history, making warranty claims and return requests easier to process.

### Supporting Canadian Jobs and Local Operations

As a Canadian-owned company, Canada Computers employs Canadians across its store network, service centers, warehouses, and corporate headquarters. The company's expansion from a single Kingston location to over 35 stores has created retail positions, technical service roles, logistics jobs, and administrative positions throughout Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, and Nova Scotia.

Store staff typically includes sales associates with technical knowledge of computer components, systems, and compatibility requirements. Service centers employ technicians trained in hardware diagnostics, warranty processing, and custom PC assembly. The company's Richmond Hill headquarters houses administrative, finance, marketing, and e-commerce teams that manage national operations.

By maintaining Canadian operations and employing local staff, the company keeps purchasing dollars within the domestic economy rather than flowing entirely to U.S.-based retailers or international conglomerates.

### How Canadians Find Deals and Savings

Canada Computers posts weekly deals on its website, rotating discounts through CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, storage, peripherals, and complete systems. These deals often coincide with manufacturer rebates or end-of-life inventory clearances. Customers can check the [Canada Computers homepage](https://www.canadacomputers.com) for current promotions.

The member deals program provides another savings channel. Free to join, the program grants access to exclusive pricing and early notification of sales events through email newsletters. Members can stack these exclusive prices with manufacturer rebates when available.

Major sale periods include Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Boxing Day, and back-to-school season in August and September. During these events, the company discounts laptops, pre-built gaming systems, monitors, peripherals, and components more aggressively than during standard weekly deals.

Customers building complete systems can sometimes negotiate bundle pricing when purchasing multiple components together, particularly during in-store consultations. While this isn't guaranteed, sales staff may accommodate requests when margins allow.

### Why Canada Computers Belongs on a Canada-Focused Site

Canada Computers represents one of the few Canadian-owned computer retailers with a national footprint. While American chains like Best Buy dominate consumer electronics retail in Canada, Canada Computers serves a specific niche: PC builders, enthusiasts, and customers seeking component-level hardware access. The company's Canadian ownership, domestic employment base, and service center network make it directly relevant to shoppers looking to support Canadian businesses while accessing technical products.

For a deals and savings website focused on Canadian consumers, Canada Computers provides a local alternative to cross-border ordering. The company's in-store pickup, Canadian warranty support, and technical service centers eliminate many of the complications associated with ordering components from U.S. retailers, including brokerage fees, extended shipping times, and warranty jurisdiction issues.

Canadian tech shoppers benefit from knowing when Canada Computers runs component sales, member-exclusive pricing, and seasonal promotions. Highlighting these opportunities helps consumers access better pricing while supporting a Canadian-owned retailer with over 30 years of history in the domestic market.
