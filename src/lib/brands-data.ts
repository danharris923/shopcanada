    "brandStory": "Find an A&WEn | FrCompany In 1956, the first A&W drive-in restaurant in Canada opened on Portage Avenue in Winnipeg. Serving a delicious combination of great-tasting burgers, onion rings and frosted mugs of famous A&W Root Beer™—all from the smiling faces of friendly car hops—A&W proved to be an instant hit. A&W Restaurants quickly multiplied across the nation, flourishing through the late '50s and '60s.Canada's original—and fastest growing—burger chain.In many communities, A&W was the first nationally branded restaurant in town. Because we were there first, our drive-ins served as \"the place to be\" in town. In fact, millions of Canadians today still carry vivid memories of special moments in their lives that took place at their local A&W drive-in. Whether they were kids in the back seat of the family sedan, or just hanging out with their best friends on a Friday night checking out the hot cars, Canadian baby boomers grew up with A&W. It's an enduring friendship that is the source of A&W's continued success across Canada.Since then, A&W has expanded to 1,050 restaurants coast-to-coast that are all Canadian owned and operated. At the heart of that growth is the fact that the simple things that made A&W so popular in our early days are the same today. We still serve A&W Root Beer™ in frosted mugs. Our Onion Rings are made fresh every day. And our Burger Family burgers are still made with fresh, quality ingredients, like our juicy grass-fed beef raised without the use of hormones and steroids.While our commitment to having the best-tasting food hasn't changed, our restaurants are dramatically different than they were in the drive-in days. As our customers' needs for convenience and faster service grew, our restaurants changed to meet those needs. The drive-ins of the '60s have been replaced by contemporary free-standing restaurants with drive-thru service and our A&W mobile app. We've also expanded into new, more convenient spaces. A&W Root Beer remains Canada's No. 1 ..."

Because happy just got a little happier. Authentic Happy Memories Canadian Heritage Polite A Step in Time 1978 Where it all started Grant and Pam Hooker serve Grant’s grandmother’s handcrafted “BeaverTails” pastries to the public for the first time at the Killaloe Craft and Community Fair in Ontario’s Ottawa Valley—marking the start of a delicious Canadian tradition. 1980 Rolling into the Big Leagues Grant takes a big leap and builds the very first BeaverTails \"store\" — a cozy 15’ x 15’ wooden booth in the heart of Ottawa’s historic ByWard Market. Small but mighty, this little booth quickly becomes a local favourite, serving up warm, handcrafted pastries with a side of Canadian charm. Decades later, it’s still there — still tiny, still busy, and still making BeaverTails pastries like the day it opened. 1981 Hitting the Ice Grant and Pam roll out the very first BeaverTails operation on Ottawa’s iconic Rideau Canal Skateway. What starts as a single stand on the frozen canal quickly becomes a full-blown winter tradition. Within just three years, four pastry huts are serving skaters along the 7.8 km stretch — with up to 350 energetic crew members bundling up and braving the cold to spread warmth, smiles, and sweet treats all season long. 1988 A Sweet Leap into Montreal Gr..."

Possessing a lifelong passion for sports and fitness, he attended Portland State University on a baseball scholarship. He was no slouch academically, either, earning his B.Sc. in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he returned to his home province to work in international technical sales for a company called Edmonton Exchanger. Dale enjoyed 8 years at Edmonton Exchanger growing their international division. While travelling throughout the United States, he noticed the popularity of juice and smoothie bars, and quickly realized there was an opportunity in the crowded Canadian fast-food market to provide a healthier alternative to consumers with an active lifestyle. Making his own protein concoctions for years, and with his interest in health and wellness, he made it a goal to bring fresh and healthy food to the Canadian market. The hard work began with his own home kitchen serving as the testing ground for one smoothie creation after another - including some of the most popular smoothies on our current menu! On November 13th, 1999, the very first Booster Juice location opened in Sherwood Park, Alberta.THE TIMING WAS PERFECT ... OR WAS IT?When the first store opened in Sherwood Park, it was a new concept to Canada. November was not the ideal time either going into the dead of a Canadian winter selling cold beverages. Co-workers, neighbours, and friends thought Dale was crazy to embark on something so foreign to Canadians when he had such a great career going at Edmonton Exchanger. If there is one trait Dale exemplifies, it is his determination. His grade 1 teacher, Mrs. Flaska, said she had never seen a student in all her years of teaching as determined as Dale. Nothing ever seems out of the realm of possibility. Not even selling smoothies in winter. As it turns out, people were ready for a healthy fast-food alternative, and there wa..."

They sell all their franchises except one. 1986 Boston Pizza debuts on the world stage as the official pizza supplier for Expo ’86 in Vancouver, B.C. generating more than $8 million in sales. Operating at Expo gave the company worldwide exposure and set the stage for expansion into the U.S. 1990 The Boston Pizza Foundation is established to raise funds for people of all ages living with difficult circumstances throughout Canada. 2001 Boston Pizza is named as a Platinum Club Member of “Canada’s 50 Best Managed Companies” and has been awarded Platinum status every subsequent year.

Fast forward a few years, and the friends and former investment bankers found themselves starting what would become the #1 Canadian Meal Kit in a tiny Montreal apartment. “We always thought about ourselves as really differentiating by getting food on the table but making it exciting. Because Montrealers know how to do food. We were able to create really interesting recipes by just going to the market, finding a couple interesting things, putting them together in a dish and then serving it to friends and family at a dinner party,” reflected Neil.Nearly 10 years later, Goodfood has hundreds of thousands of customers across Canada, but we’re still choosing our recipes and ingredients just as carefully. “We won’t serve anything that we wouldn’t be proud to serve our families at Sunday dinner,” explained Jonathan. Good for business, good for everyone We’re doing this by sourcing our ingredients responsibly—a strategy that’s good for the business, our customers and the planet.“From a business perspective, we want to be involved in solving the world's biggest challenges because that’s where the greatest opportunities can be found. One of the biggest problems of our generation is to solve our climate crisis. It’s our generation’s responsibility to drive sustainable transformation across all industries, and Goodfood is leading th..."

Those are the things we’ve been obsessed with since Day One: making a healthier, smoother and more delicious shake is why Good Protein exists. We’ve spent years testing, tasting and sourcing the best ingredients to create plant-based shakes that taste exactly like your favourite sweet snacks and juices that are as satisfying as a freshly squeezed glass — all while offering your body everything it deserves. Super Good Superfoods Satisfying No more gritty textures, unpleasant aftertastes or bland flavours. Satisfy your body’s needs and your cravings with the same sip. High Quality We’re obsessed with finding the best ingredients in the world, because they’re often more nutritious and taste better. You’ll never find anything artificial in our products, only real, all-natural, plant-based ingredients that are GMO-, dairy-, gluten- and soy-free. More than Protein Our shakes and juices offer way more than just protein: they help curb cravings, improve your digestion, support your immune system, offer more energy and give you everything you need to keep your muscles healthy. This is Edward He founded Good Protein. But he was obsessed with health and nutrition long before that.Along the way he tried all the supplements and protein shakes out there, but they always left a bad taste in his mouth. Not only did they have a gritty texture and unappetizing taste, but they also focused on one aspect of what the body needed at the expense of others — like feeling bloated after a supposedly healthy shake. So, in 2019, Edward started scouring the world for the best suppliers and the highest-quality ingredients, with a single goal in mind: to create a shake that complements your daily diet – a nutritionally rich solution that provides essential nutrients for the body's well-being. Today, we’ve sold over 60 MILLION shakes in 12 different flavours, not to mention an immune system-supporting Green Superfood Juice, an energizing, antioxi..."

Mary Brown’s is real, wholesome, comfort food, made fresh daily. It’s always been that way – and always will be. We won’t settle for less. The Mary Brown’s Story It was 1969. While the world watched the first man walk on the moon, we celebrated the first Guest walking through our doors in St. John’s, Newfoundland & Labrador. Needless to say, it was a giant leap for chicken. Word quickly spread and stores opened across the province. It soon became the chicken of choice. Iconic even. It was time to, pardon the pun, spread our wings. By 1972, the secret of Mary Brown’s tantalizing chicken was out. Two stores opened in Ontario that year in Oshawa and Mississauga. From there, growth expanded west to Alberta, back east to the Maritimes, out to the Prairies and more recently, all the way to British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. Today there are almost 300 Mary Brown’s locations across Canada, and that number keeps climbing rapidly – coast-to-coast, in small towns and big cities – as more and more Canadians fall in l..."

After explaining that current makeup brands and collections simply don’t appeal to their no-nonsense attitude, they created NUDESTIX. NUDESTIX believes that your natural skin should thrive, and that you only need to cover here and there to get that perfectly, “go nude but better” look. OUR MISSION \"I believe the 'natural look' works well for every face. We're all born with our own unique look. When it comes to makeup, a little goes a long way. A dot here and a smudge there does the trick. Nudestix is all about embracing the beautiful in you.\" xx Ally\"I've always believed in a wash of color, so out with the crazy colors and in with the nudes. Out with the bag overflowing with compacts and brushes and in with simple makeup crayons for the face, eyes, lips and even cheeks. I think makeup should be easy, fast and—above all—fun! Nudestix is about effortless beauty - it's 'no-makeup' makeup you just draw and smudge on for perfection in an instant.\" xx Taylor OUR PROMISE The best part about our beauty brand is that it’s 100% easy, multi-tasking, fun and skin-loving !

PROUDLY MADE IN CANADA SINCE 2000 Rooted in their connection to the outdoors, Rocky co-owners Cam and Karina pioneered natural beauty products from their small mountain town in the Canadian Rockies. They grew Rocky from a local gem into what it is today—more than two decades strong, fueled by their passion and commitment to natural ingredients. INTENTIONAL FORMULAS We use only Earth’s ingredients—carefully selected and obsessively formulated by our science team and in-house herbalist. Mindfully crafted in our workshop, we incorporate only what is essential and good. We prioritize Canadian ingredients. Since quality and availability can vary, we also work with trusted suppliers worldwide, ensuring that every ingredient meets our rigorous standards of quality. Once an ingredient passes our standards, we begin the formulation phase. This process often requires more than 50 prototypes to perfect each formula and can sometimes take several years. Learn more about our natural standards CONSCIOUS PRODUCTION Once our formulas are perfected, our manufacturing team (located right in the same building as our lab) begins production. Although we’ve grown, we still do things slowly. It still takes six weeks to make our cold-process bar soap, and we still hand-press our bath bombs—we just have a lot more hands now. Next, we manage the distribution of our products. The fact that we do it all right here means we maintain meticulous oversight over all aspects from sourcing to packaging ensuring the highest level of care and consistency throughout the entire process. “Having our lab and workshop in the same building allows our team to collaborate closely.

    "brandStory": "About Us The Beginning of Stanfield's Charles E. Stanfield had no idea when he immigrated to Canada in 1855 that he would found the firm that would become recognized as Canada's leading manufacturer of men's underwear. In the beginning, Charles, along with his brother-in-law, Samuel E. Dawson, founded the Tryon Woolen Mills in Tryon, P.E.I. in 1856. Ten years later he sold his interests to Samuel and moved to Nova Scotia. In 1870 he founded the Truro Woolen Mills, which at that time was located on Brunswick Street. It was believed to be the first factory of its kind in Canada. Tryon Woolen Mills, Tryon, Prince Edward Island - 1856 During this period, Charles was constantly looking to expand the operation. He purchased other mills around eastern Canada, including the Carding Mill in St. Croix, NS (1872) which he renamed the Ste. Croix Wool Factory. After a few years, Charles and family sold the Ste. Croix mill to Alxander Dunbar and returned to Truro to focus there. This marked the official renaming to the Stanfield Mill. As the company grew, the factory was relocated from Brunswick Street to its current location on the south bank of the Salmon River (Logan Street) in 1882. These important events would be crucial to setting the company up for success in the coming decades and century. Stanfield’s annual stag picnic. August 17, 1935 Building A Brand Charles was a creative genius. He maintained a workshop in a barn behind his house where he spent the majority of his time creating new equipment and products. He developed and manufactured the first cardigan jackets and stockinettes in Canada. He introduced Canadians to heavy rib underwear and the famous “Drop Seat.” He also manufactured sweater cloth and knitting yarn. In 1896, Charles sold his business to his two sons, John and Frank Stanfield who had their own vision for the company’s future. They believed the way to build a reputation was to build a stable product line in one specific field, despite their father’s adv..."

For five generations, we have been renowned for our devotion to customer care. Today, our more than dozen stores are a dazzling tribute to architecture, art, attentive service, and to a shopping experience second to none.” - Richard and Peter Simons 1840 | Our origins The birth of a legendary family business Our story began in 1812 when Peter Simons arrived from Scotland and settled on a small farm near Quebec City to raise his family of five. In 1840 his son Archibald moved into the city to open a small shop, where he sold dry goods and various imported wares. To make sure his business received the latest in goods from Europe, he made over 70 Atlantic crossings by sailing ship. In those early days, Archibald Simons was already putting an emphasis on quality merchandise and attentive service, setting the stage for the future success of La Maison Simons. 1870 | Old Quebec A golden history In 1870, John Simons moved his shop to 20 côte de la Fabrique, where it remains to this day, along with the Simons head office. The building's charming 19th century façade and interior arches are just a few of the architectural elements that bear witness to the store's rich past. The store was enlarged in 2005 and renovated in 2007. Modern Times The Sixties | Creating exclusive brands Donald Simons was part of that generation of young entrepreneurs who possessed remarkable intuition and a true spirit of innovation. In the booming postwar years, he quickly saw the importance of serving the needs of an increasingly modern society. Under his influence, La Maison Simons created exciting new fashion brands in Quebec. The sixties saw the birth of Twik, in sync with the day's new young woman of 16 to 25. This exclusiv..."

We’ve been around through every season, era, and cultural shift. Our very first shoe, the Frida clog, was a bold reimagining of traditional Swedish and Japanese designs - our first shot at trying something different. It was unique, distinctly modern, and in tune with the free-thinking, rebellious, and curious spirit of the 70’s. That spark? It’s still in everything we do. Decade after decade, we’ve designed with the same joie de vivre. Trying has always defined us. Nerves and excitement are our north star, we find joy in the journey. We take inspiration from the world and the people in it to create wearable styles that inspire self-expression, bring fun into the everyday, and outlive the trends to become a beloved core memory in your closet. Our Founder StoryThe grandson of a shoe cobbler, son of a shoe merchant - our founder Aldo Bensadoun was, in many ways, destined to follow in footsteps. Yet it was his unique upbringing and his deep curiosity about the world that inspired him to forge his own path in the creation of ALDO - a brand built on passion, purpose, and innovation. Designed In MontrealIn 1972, Aldo founded his company in Montreal - a city in progress, evolving into an international centre of culture and commerce. It was a global crossroads where diverse worldviews, styles, and traditions converged to shape new, collective visions. Today, ALDO designs with the same spirit of curiosity and connection. Our designers work together to create with purpose and passion - constantly exchanging stories and ideas, and finding inspiration together. First MilestonesALDO began as a modest concession stand in a local department store - a small footprint with big appeal. Our very first shoe, the Frida Clog, quickly became a hit, sparking the rise of ALDO as a b..."

    "brandStory": "Our Story our origin storyAs a young Métis entrepreneur, Sean McCormick began Manitobah Mukluks with the vision of creating a successful company while benefiting his community. Today we continue that vision on a larger scale, as a global brand making a positive impact in Indigenous communities across North America. Sean McCormick spent much of his childhood in northern Manitoba and started selling leather and fur while still in high school. In 1990, he established a trading post where Indigenous artisans traded handmade mukluks and moccasins for tanned leather, skins and furs. During this time, Sean saw an even greater opportunity to connect members of his community to the growing demand for authentic Indigenous footwear. In 1996, after completing the Manitoba Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneurship Training Program, Sean created the business plan and framework that would become Manitobah. In 2008, Manitobah began global operations and today it is one of Canada’s fastest-growing companies, with employees and customers worldwide. Despite the rapid success and growth of the brand, Manitobah remains connected to its roots and continues to provide authentic, Indigenous-designed products that return value to Indigenous communities. Manitobah became a certified B Corporation™ in 2023, a designation that demonstrates a business meets high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials. Manitobah – Founded 1997 – Winnipeg, Manitoba 10,000 Years of designThe original winter boot is a mukluk and the original shoe is a moccasin. Designed 10,000 years ago to keep Indigenous people warm, the unique blend of form, function, and material allows them to thrive in the world’s coldest conditions. All of our designs honour and continue the history of innovation, craftsmanship, and beauty. Can I wear moccasins and mukluks if I am not Indigenous? Absolutely! We make our m..."

Yeah, you could call us hopeless romantics. Working for ourselves was always the obvious choice, and who wouldn’t want to work with their bestie?!You see, we are a little bit of retail nerds with an obsession for authentic customer service. Our favourite thing to do when visiting a new place is to check out it’s trendy independent shops. Gathering inspiration and learning how other retail businesses differentiate always excites us. It must be in our blood or something cause together we have always wanted to provide a special shopping experience. Until in 2014 when Sash + Bustle came to be we didn’t exactly know what that meant.Sash + Bustle has some how married (pun intended) all of our skill sets andpassions as individuals. One of our favourite work-perks is that S+B allows us to be a small part of a bride’s wedding day, which we couldn’t be more honoured for. Supporting other women has always been a driving force for us. It gives us the warm and fuzzies when someone lights up in a gown, when they feel like the best version of themselves and they just FEEL great.

Our Founder A lover of jewelry and all its intricacies, Mel has always been a proponent of reimagining a classic and telling a story through exquisitely designed pieces. Melanie’s journey to jewelry started as a passion and a curiosity and after attending countless metalsmithing classes, she was guided toward what would soon become her career, creating modern yet nostalgic jewelry. Travel is a key element in sparking inspiration and new ideas into Melanie’s designs. Exploration allows her to refresh and rejuvenate, creating space to put her process in motion and connect to new people and places that will inevitably inform her designs. It wasn’t until after years of traveling and living abroad that she settled down in Vancouver with her husband and two children, realizing then, that designing jewelry was her passion. In 2013, her namesake, Melanie Auld Jewelry, was born, a collection of fine and demi-fine pieces that ignite connection and mark meaningful moments, both big and small. Each item showcases the power of storytelling and the people and places we meet along the way. Our Jewelry Melanie Auld Jewelry crafts timeless, versatile, custom, and conversation-starting pieces that are meant to be layered and styled to evolve over time. Personalization is at the heart of MAJ and customers have the option to create a signature piece that represents their unique story with our elevated offering. Pulling from Melanie’s heritage, the majority of MAJ’s pieces are crafted in Italy using recycled materials.With a keen focus on aesthetics, our jewelry is rooted in creating small connections. So often, jewelry is purchased to mark a pivotal occasion, but we don’t believe that has to be the case. The small ones matter, too. From memorable excursions to first apartments, our jewelry commemorates the stories that make us human. Our Boutiques Melanie Auld boutiq..."

    "brandStory": "About us Hi! I’m Sara Escobar, the hands and heart behind each piece you’ll find here. Originally from Colombia and now based in Canada, I’m a professional social worker with a deep passion for human connection, creativity, and storytelling. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with diverse communities across Colombia, listening to powerful stories and learning from every experience. During one of those journeys, I discovered a traditional bead-weaving technique that immediately resonated with me. What started as a meditative and personal escape quickly evolved into a meaningful form of self-expression—and a way to uplift other women through handmade accessories full of intention. Each piece I create is a reflection of inner exploration, cultural heritage, and a deep love for slow, purposeful craftsmanship. My work blends organic and geometric designs, and every accessory is made by hand in my cozy studio in Keswick, Ontario, using refined weaving techniques with thread and wire. You can find my creations at art and craft shows in Toronto, California, and Colombia, as well as at select consignment stores, including: Savile Studio and Market Amazing Graze | Mississauga Hometown Heart Store Ltd Every design can be customized in a wide range of colors and is made to be lightweight, waterproof, and vibrant—unique pieces for unique people. Thank you for being here and for supporting handmade art that tells a story. 💛"

Ricky’s expanded in the 1980s to include full lunch and dinner. As well, in 2014, Ricky’s acquired ABC Country Restaurants, a chain that had delivered great country fare for over 40 years. This merge brought together two great brands, both with a rich history of delivering exceptional food and service to Canadian families. In 2017, the Ricky’s brand further expanded with the launch of Ricky’s Café, a new contemporary café concept with an express burger and sandwich bar and gourmet home meal takeout service. All while still serving the famous breakfasts and high quality lunch and dinner items Ricky’s is known for. With ongoing expansion, including new locations opening in Alberta and BC, Ricky’s has 85+ locations across Canada to serve you. There's Always Something New at Ricky's As the number of our locations continues to grow, so does our menu. Ricky’s breakfast menu has been enhanced to include favourites like Eggs Benedict, and our now famous Brekkie-Bowls. Lunch has everything you want with mouthwatering sandwiches and fresh never frozen ½lb Canadian Certified Angus Beef Burgers.

    "brandStory": "Our Story WHY BREAKFAST? We believe that breakfast should be bolstered by artistry and passion. Our chef-driven concept is led with soul, where the emphasis lies on the people that produce, create, serve and consume our fresh, iconic cuisine. On your plate? Familiar classics balanced with unreplicatable fare you simply won’t find anywhere else. With the philosophy of “learn, teach and inspire,” our welcoming spaces each tell their own unique stories. Together, we provide an exceptional, ever-evolving experience – leaving you soul-full. Our Chef Who Is Mauro? Our spirited founder and classically trained Chef, Mauro Martina, has cultivated a culture that prioritizes connection and genuine food integrity. Mauro spent his childhood in Italy, exposed to fresh, rich ingredients of local markets on a daily basis. For Mauro, these experiences were centered on incredible food, but more importantly, connecting with those who cultivated their bounties with love. With his culinary foundation built in Europe, Mauro moved to Canada in 1992. It was here that he embarked on his career as an executive chef at just 21. Mauro quickly climbed the ranks in both Toronto and Calgary, and in 2009, he fed his entrepreneurial spirit by forging a farm-to-table experience for the meal that fuels us all – breakfast. Today, Mauro remains at the helm of OEB and its growth – bringing his unmistakable energy to farmers fields’, bustling OEB spaces and vibrant kitchens. Our Vision WHAT’S NEXT? OEB was established in 2009; in Calgary – a Canadian city with big potential and small-town values. We pride ourselves on a vision that supports our people – from farming partners, to chefs, managers, employees, and finally, our incredible guests. We aim to invest in, educate and broaden horizons with every connection we make. The people at OEB possess a deep love of food, giving staff the confidence to excite and welcome guests. The OEB menu is purposeful, filled with items that simply can’t be made at home, ..."

    "brandStory": "It’s always been about Wonder and Warmth.Our story started well before we served Monogram’s first coffee. We (Ben, Justin and Jeremy) met working together as three overly-excited baristas eagerly starting out on our coffee journey. What made those times so special was that everything was about discovery, exploration and learning about coffee. It seemed like everyday brought new tastes, new techniques, and new friends. Despite coming from three different backgrounds (music, health sciences and development), we came together because of our shared love of exploring the world of coffee.However, we quickly realized that specialty coffee at the time exuded an air of elitism and exclusiveness that we didn’t feel comfortable with. We knew firsthand that exploring the amazing world of specialty coffee was better shared, and not part of some exclusive club. So we started Monogram to create a place where we could passionately pursue some of the world’s best coffee, and use it to bring people together. Ever since, we’ve made it our mission to make it easy for all people to discover amazing coffee. Since our humble beginnings serving coffee from our hand-built coffee cart, celebrating flavour has always been a part of our DNA. The way our coffee tastes is inspired by the many people and experiences around the world that play a role. Firstly, our long-term coffee producing relationships. Mariana Iturralde leads a team at Finca Takesi that raises and nurtures beautiful coffee in some of the world’s harshest growing conditions. Jamison Savage from Finca Deborah and the Lamastus family from Elida estate in Panama are constantly at the forefront of processing technique. And Daterra blends innovative technology with a passion for the rainforest to make one of the world’s most environmentally sustainable coffee farms.Secondly is the Monogram team. We are photographers, foodies, runners, and musicians. There are science geeks, content creators, gamers and everything in between. Throw in..."

Since then, we have grown to 16 distinct locations and can be found on the shelves of grocery stores across the country.Find A Café What distinguishes Balzac's, aside from unrivalled roasts and formidable female leadership, is that every café is specifically designed to embody the cultural nuances and historical significance of the location it's in. In doing so, each café has carved out a unique personality as a central gathering place for locals. People come to a Balzac’s café to converse and debate, to fall in love and create. And the fact that all Balzac's cafés have garnered quite the loyal following proves that providing a place for people to drink excellent coffee in the authentic French tradition has an appeal that can only be described as everlasting.

Reducing consumption reduces waste, so we designed our palettes to be endlessly refillable and customizable allowing you to make purposeful choices and individually buy only the products and shades you know you will use. Plus, what is better than having a palette designed by you and for you that holds all your makeup in one convenient place? Earth-FirstSustainable MaterialsWe carefully select our materials with consideration of their environmental impact which is why all palettes and refills are made with PET and PP resin, the easiest to recycle. Additionally, we use post-consumer recycled content (reusing material that already exists in the waste stream vs. using new virgin material) as much as possible. Our face, eye, and mascara refills are made with 100% PCR material, and our palettes are made with at least 50%! Using post-consumer recycled materials can be more expensive and challenging because it's difficult to work with, and our packaging was the first time most of our suppliers had ever used our requested material composition. 100% Biodegradable PackagingIdeally, packaging only lasts the life of your product, so we designed our individual compacts, jars, and capsules with a fully biodegradable material. After use, pop out refills for recycling with the Pact Collective and home compost or toss your empty packaging in your blue bin for easy curbside recycling.

We believe in self-expression without limits, without labels, and without compromise. Whether you're 19 or 99, beauty is yours to define. DO MORE WITH LESS Our approach is simple: do more with less. We create multi-functional, high-performance makeup essentials for building, blending, buffing, smudging, and doing what you want. Makeup is an embellishment, an accessory, and above all, temporary. We embrace and find beauty in the smears, strokes, creases, and the time spent with ourselves to make up or just to touch up. Every product is cruelty-free, vegan, and free of synthetic fragrances. Sustainability matters to us, too. That’s why we prioritize recycled and recyclable materials while minimizing plastic use. . WHO WE ARE 19/99 is female founded, female owned, and based in Toronto, Canada. We believe beauty isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s personal, ever-evolving, and limitless. Partnering with industry visionaries Diti Katona and Simone Otis, we’re challenging outdated standards and reshaping the conversation around beauty and self-expression. This isn’t just makeup. It’s a movement. And we’d love for you to be part of it. - Camille & Stephanie, founders of 19/99 Beauty"

After struggling to find an effective diaper rash remedy, Registered Pharmacist Chad Zelensky used his clinical expertise to create a natural balm using high-quality, locally sourced, and unrefined ingredients.The result? A gentle yet powerful formula that cleared Lowen’s rash within days—and it never returned. Our youngest, Simone, and many other babies have since benefited from our balms, avoiding diaper rash altogether.Realizing that many parents faced similar struggles, we set out to share our solution and help families everywhere care for their children’s skin naturally. With that mission in mind, Lowen’s Natural Skincare was born.After launching our flagship Butter Balm, we expanded our line through research and persistence to include a wide range of balms, lotions, cleansers, scrubs, hair care products, and creams. Today, we continue to innovate—developing new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers and our own family. We Formulate Our Products Based On These Four Principles Safe for us = Safe for you We formulate our products using evidence-based, peer-reviewed, and personally-tested ingredients to ensure they are safe for you and your family. We ensure that our ingredients are thoroughly evaluated for safety, effectiveness, environmental impact, and animal welfare by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Keeping it Simple We formulate our products with hard-working ingredients. What this means is that any single ingredient can provide multiple benefits within a particular product. This keeps our ingredients list to a minimum number of “simple” components. Do no Harm We do not test our products on animals nor do we purchase ingredients that have been tested on animals.

Reversa: Over 30 years of innovation In 1990, Dermtek launched and marketed their Ombrelle sunscreen. It was the first product to protect against UVA and UVB rays, which was a feat in and of itself in dermatological care at the time. The product line had so much success that L’Oréal bought it in 1997.______________________________________________After Ombrelle’s skin protection products, the next logical step was to correct skin damage caused by sun exposure. It is with this in mind that the Reversa brand was created and each of the brand’s products seeks to respond to the diverse needs of its consumers. ______________________________________________Reversa was one of the first brands to use glycolic acid as its main active ingredient, but the innovation didn’t stop there. Such innovation is seen daily at Reversa, since all our products are created by our team of experts. Every formula comes directly from our laboratory in Pointe-Claire, Québec.

It was one of the most dazzlingly colourful summers in history, with all eyes on the cosmopolitan city of Montréal, who was playing host to the World’s Fair.The Fair was a kaleidoscope of cultural diversity, and a vibrant, visionary celebration of humanity.A sense explosive human potential was spreading like wildfire from the hippie love-ins of San Francisco to the ivory towers of academia in Paris.As a child of that era, Annabelle captured both its vibrant colour and its message of empowerment with the notion of Colour Power. We built a reputation for its extraordinary variety of bold shades and nuanced hues, created to inspire women to freely experiment and express their own powerful and colourful sense of personal style.Today, nearly fifty years later, the power of self-expression has reached a whole new level as women of all ages and backgrounds celebrate and share their beauty and strength on Youtube, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram. The faces and messages of the beauty industry are changing for the positive, and we’re excited to be a part of that change.Our Colour Power is stronger than ever, and it’s our dream to help women everywhere find and have fun expressing a power all their own. Annabelle believes that it’s not the way you look that counts – it’s how you look at the world. A strong connection to what makes us unique is what makes us truly beautiful. And when we bring that beauty light, it can turn even the most ordinary day into something powerfully beautiful."

    "brandStory": "Buck Naked Our Story Buck Naked was born out of necessity. When baby Elias, son of Buck Naked founders Rina and John, developed skin irritations from traditional baby products, they soon realized they needed a truly natural alternative. As necessity is the mother of all invention, the Chamomile & Calendula Soap was invented to help soothe the little guy’s skin. With this creation, Rina discovered her passion of formulating skin care products using the purest of ingredients. Since inception, we’ve introduced a full line of all-natural, vegan, handcrafted skin care products. We’re committed to being chemical-free, using only pure, natural ingredients. On this, we are unwavering: if you can't (or shouldn’t) eat it, we won't use it. Why Natural? Our skin is our body’s largest organ. We don't often think about it, but it’s our first line of defense against potentially harmful bacteria and contaminants. The thin layer of sebum that covers our bodies works like an invisible shield. At 22 incredible square feet, our skin deserves to be nurtured and nourished with the best quality of ingredients. However, our skin is also porous, which means that between 13% (the bottom of our feet) and 100% (underarms and groin) of the products we put onto our skin is absorbed within 26 seconds. Although federally-approved, many traditional products contain a variety of chemicals that soak into our skin and bloodstream in that 26-second window and potentially disrupt our bodies' natural balances. Some chemicals, like sodium laureth sulfate (a detergent and lather booster), can contain contaminates that are considered possible human carcinogens – harmful to the nervous system, and classified as possible developmental toxicants. This is why Buck Naked Soap Company makes only natural skin care products. [Read more…]"

FOUNDER'S STORY When asked how I got started in this business, I often find myself reflecting on the journey that has unfolded. What began as a hobby in my kitchen, turned into our family’s full-time livelihood. It’s been an exciting adventure; one that I believe is part of a greater plan and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to continue leading and growing Pure Anada. My professional background began in hairstyling, where I enjoyed the creativity of working in a salon and the relationships I built with clients. However, over time I began to develop sensitivities to some of the products and chemicals commonly used in the industry. I found myself relying on prescription creams for my hands and taking daily allergy medication just to get through the day. Growing up, I was always conscious of health and wellness, thanks to my mother who taught me the value of nourishing the body with wholesome, natural foods. As a child, I was the one bringing homemade whole grain bread and apple juice from our family orchard to school. She instilled in m..."

It was ingrained in me from a young age with a mother and grandmother who were both knowledgeable and wise in herbology, wellness and nutrition. My beloved mother lost her heroic battle to an autoimmune disease in 2013. Losing her has made me even more protective of women's health and longevity. When I was expecting my first baby, I became extremely sensitive to all of my conventional beauty products, especially synthetic scent. I couldn't find a skincare line I truly loved. I felt compelled to innovate a luxurious, plant-powered line. Growing up, I'll never forget the bliss of dipping my toes into her bubble baths, and her sensorial nighttime skincare routine. I can still remember the smell of her night cream from when I kissed her goodnight. As a mother of three, I'm my own customer who craves a clean skincare ritual that calms, heals, and repairs. From filling orders as a mad scientist in my unfinished basement, to shipping our products worldwide, being chosen to be Fleetwood Mac's official skincare for their last world tour, or seeing your reviews come in, we are a proud Canadian-made brand. Thanks to our loyal community who inspire me daily, we have never felt more loved and empowered to help women feel confident in their own skin and to age with power. Thank you for supporting a little girl's dream who had a potion step at the side of her home, and for trusting PURA to be a part of your invaluable self care rituals and healthy skin. In pure we trust. With Love,Lane Edwards Founder & Director Pura Botanicals Inc."

Since then, founder Jessica Burman has spent two decades studying aromatherapy, perfumery, and plant science to create skincare that’s luxurious, ethical, and deeply effective. Where It All Began In 2003, a simple natural cream transformed a loved one’s skin and changed Jessica’s life. The following year, she earned her Aromatherapy Certification, studying how plant essences affect both skin and mood. This was the true beginning of her formulating career — blending art, science, and a deep respect for the skin’s natural balance. Learning the Language of Scent To refine her craft, Jessica travelled to Provence to study at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery — the historic home of fine fragrance. Among lavender fields and distilleries, she learned to compose scent with restraint, emotion, and respect for sensitive skin. These lessons shaped Cocoon’s signature aromatic identity: perfumes of purpose, not overpowering fragrance. Mastering Plant Distillation Later, in Spokane, Washington, Jessica studied plant distillation under world-renowned distiller Ann Harman. Working hands-on with copper stills and fresh botanicals, she learned how to capture the purest expressions of plants. That knowledge lives in every Cocoon formula — in the way our ingredients are chosen, extracted, and combined. Two Decades of Conscious Craftsmanship 2003Cocoon Apothecary is founded in Kitchener, Ontario. 2004Jessica earns her Aromatherapy Certification and begins formulating in earnest. 2006One of Canada’s early online natural-skincare stores goes live, sharing ingredient transparency before it was mainstream. 2011Awarded Champion Status with the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, a coalition of 150 non-profits who worked to elimate dangerous chemicals from personal care. 2014Our own factory and retail shop opens, maintaining production in-house for full contro..."

It’s a call to action that fuels our passion for healthier, more convenient, and more sustainable ways of eating, doing business, and supporting the communities we live in.Our story starts with a simple question: \"What’s for dinner?\"In 2014, lifelong friends Becky Brauer, Dhruv Sood, and Husein Rahemtulla set out to make home-cooked meals easier for busy people—without the waste that often came with traditional meal kits. Fresh Prep was born: a local, innovative solution that made meal kits more sustainable and a whole lot smarter.In 2024, Fresh Prep acquired Cook it, a beloved Montreal-based meal kit company, and rebranded it in 2025 to expand across Canada—bringing even more Canadians an easier, better way to eat well.We’re changing how Canada does dinner.Less packaging & food wasteWe deliver in reusable cooler bags and offer most recipes in our patented Zero Waste Kit. We are continuing to scale our zero-waste solutions—because better meals shouldn't come with more waste.We also partner with Canadian organizations to fight food insecurity, reduce food waste, and donate meals to those in need—year-round.Fresher, quality ingredientsWe work with Canadian suppliers and producers who share our commitment to sustainability, sourcing fresh, high-quality ingredients for our chef-inspired recipes and ready-to-eat meals. We offer sustainably sourced seafood and antibiotic-free meat and poultry. Recipe ingredients are carefully chopped, prepared, and portioned to minimize waste and make mealtime easy.Delivering the promiseWe don’t rely on third-party couriers—we proudly operate our own delivery fleet. That means better quality control, convenient delivery windows, and real- time tracking, so you always know when your order is arriving. To reduce our impact, all deliveries are carbon offset, making them 100% net zero emissions.Fresh Prep was created with one simple goal: to offer something better.

I started out as a biotechnologist, working in chemical and food manufacturing, but over time, I realized I wanted something different. I wanted to create clean, natural products—something truly good for the skin, free from harmful chemicals, and made with intention. What began as a passion project in my kitchen quickly grew into aweSOAP, a brand dedicated to beautiful, effective, and non-toxic soaps, candles, and skincare. Every product I make is a blend of science, nature, and artistry, using premium ingredients, natural colorants, and pure essential oils to craft something special. But aweSOAP isn't just my business—it's a family effort. My loved ones have been by my side every step of the way, from testing products to helping with packaging and markets. Their support and encouragement fuel my passion, making aweSOAP more than just a brand—it's a reflection of the love and care we put into everything we create. ​ Now, three years in, aweSOAP has become more than just a business—it’s a way for me to share my love for high-quality, skin-loving products with people who care about what they put on their bodies. Whether it’s a bar of soap infused with botanicals or a candle that fills a space with warmth, every item is made with passion, integrity, and a whole lot of love! Thanks for being here and supporting my journey—I can’t wait for you to experience aweSOAP! ​ With gratitude, Kat"

    "brandStory": "At Petland our guests are assured that we will counsel them in finding the right companion pet for them and the right products to enhance their enjoyment with their pets. We hope that you will become part of our team and help us make that happen. If you ask the coach of a football team how he motivates winners, he’ll tell you that you can’t motivate winners; you have to recruit them. The desire to win, to be the best you can be, is essential to success in life. If you have that desire, we can show you how to channel it. It’s one thing to love animals. Its’ something else to be able to care for a whole store of them. And it’s something else altogether to be able to meet new people, to talk to them about their wants and needs in a pet and them help them to make a decision – the right decision – about meeting those needs. It’s all in the timing... The Petland team begins their work sometimes two or more hours before the store opens and they continue after the store closes. Everybody has a position and each person must be there on time and in uniform. We are open almost every day of the year. Even when we are closed the pets in the store must still be cared for. That means someone must feed them clean up after them and provide special attention on Christmas, Easter and every other holiday. Everybody works week nights and weekends. That’s when most of our guests are here. You won’t have to work them all, but you will be required to do your fair share. If for some reason you can’t get to work on time, it is up to you to call in with plenty of advanced notice So, the first questions you need to consider for this job are: What hours are you available to work? Can you be flexible? Can you get to work on time? Clean, clean, clean Everybody who inquires about working with Petland loves animals. If you don’t love animals, you won’t like working here But caring for hundreds of animals in a store is different than caring for one or two at home. It’s a lot of work. Everyone a Petl..."

Our MissionTo be the first choice of individuals who love steak by allowing Keggers and guests to be themselves. Our Story In 1971 our founder George Tidball opened the very first Keg under the name Keg n’ Cleaver in North Vancouver. He did so with one simple formula in mind – elevate the every day for our guests by surrounding great food with good times. The Beginning | 1970's The Keg gains momentum as classics like The Keg Caesar and the Billy Miner Pie join the menu. The Keg becomes known for ‘good times’ and the famous phrase “See You Tonight” is coined. Transition | 1980's George Tidball’s run as owner comes to an end, as he sells The Keg to UK-based company Whitbread. The Keg’s first patio opens on Leslie Street in Toronto and the internal staff event ‘Keg Cup’ expands its reach to eastern Canada, marking an annual national tradition. Keg Bread becomes the infamous start of a great night out. A New Vision | 1990's The Keg’s Chairman, David Aisenstat, acquires The Keg and transforms it into what you know today – accessible, upscale, and consistent dining driven by an internal culture that can only be found here. The Keg focuses on heightened hospitality and sees the inception of a ‘Keg Classic’ meal. Keg Size Growth | 2000's After more than 30 years of business, The Keg opens its 100th location. Reflecting on our history of giving back to communities across North America, The Keg Spirit Foundation is formed, focusing on charitable giving towards youth and development programs. The Keg retail products are also launched, allowing guests to enjoy some of The Keg exper..."

    "brandStory": "Company History Ben Moss Jewellers was established in 1910 as one of Canada’s first independent and family-owned fine jewellery store companies. It unfortunately suffered from external forces that left it financially vulnerable in recent years and a wholesaler acquired the chain in 2013. The company filed for creditor protection in May 2016, and closed all stores. In January 2017, Charm Diamond Centres acquired the rights to the trademark Ben Moss and is re-opening 16 Ben Moss Jewellers stores in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. Founded in 1972 by Richard Calder, Charm Diamond Centres, with Crescent Gold and Diamonds, is Canada’s largest independently owned and operated jewellery company. Under these three retail banners, Charm operates more than 88 stores and employs more than 800 people from Newfoundland to B.C. Charm’s mission is to ‘Win the Customer for Life’ by providing quality, value, and trusted service to all its customers. Charm Diamond Centres is a Canada Top 50 Best Managed Company. Charm Diamond Centres has great respect for the Ben Moss Jewellers legacy and its long history. Like Charm, the company has a similar story – it is a family-owned Canadian fine jewellery brand that customers have trusted for their most treasured memories."

It was a modest effort: a small store with a great design and a strong concept that impressed one of Canada’s largest mall operators who wisely decided to take a chance on a new tenant with no track record. A concept was developed that consumers immediately loved, and a strong following pursued. The name Yogen implies yogurt, of course, and Früz calls forth “frozen”, “fruit” and “fresh”, all of which play a part in the Yogen Früz concept. REALLY, REALLY GOOD We are a healthier, better for you lifestyle brand. Today with our new assortment of proprietary probiotic frozen yogurt and our dairy and non dairy smoothies, as well as our light ice cream offering, we continue our strong tradition of market innovation/leadership. NATURAL With our Flavürs menu, the fruits natural colour and natural sugar is preserved in a product that is as creamy as soft serve, and comparable to or better than the best super-premium ice cream, anywhere in the world. All natural, nothing artificial. HEALTHY Our products come in low fat vanilla, low fat chocolate, non fat, no sugar added and non dairy bases. It’s the perfect attributes for today’s health conscious consumer. When the consumer discovers that the product tastes so good, and has a fifth the fat and half the calories of ice cream, Yogen Früz creates a friend for life. It’s a product and a system that appeals to people of all ages – men and women alike. FLAVOURFUL The frozen yogurt is pre-packaged in single serving bars, comes in vanilla and chocolate flavours. The selection of fruit, which is used for blending with the yogurt varies and depends on local availability and customer preferences.

    "brandStory": "Our Story Hey there! I’m Heather, the founder of BUFF Snacks, a proudly woman-owned Canadian brand built on bison sized boldness in all aspects of life and business. I’m a mom and stepmom to four amazing teens, wife to my biggest supporter, and a full-time food lover. Feeding people has always been my love language, so it’s not surprising that my winding path led me here- creating better ways to help people snack! When I’m not running BUFF, I also run an agri-tourism business with my husband (redneckranch.ca) that revolves around a huge U-pick garden, and our funny farm animals- another way for me to share my passion for quality, local food. How BUFF Started BUFF began because I didn’t love what was out there for my meat-loving kiddos. I was tired of scrolling endless aisles of snacks that pretended to be healthy but were really packed with sugar, fillers, and buzzwords instead of real nutrition. BUFF was born from years of curiosity - bringing in meat snacks from across North America in 2014, studying how they were made, and learning what worked (and what didn’t). Between running a farm, wrangling kids, and trying to grab something quick that didn’t taste like cardboard dipped in marketing jargon - I knew there had to be a better way, so, I made one! I created something I was truly proud of - something I was happy to feed my kids. Not junk disguised as “natural,” but real, high-quality protein snacks made the right way. What started as a mom’s mission turned into a movement: snacking that’s simple, real, and ridiculously good. Real Protein for Real Life! Why Bison? Because bison are strong, pure, and unapologetically wild- exactly the kind of energy I wanted in a snack and in life! Our meat sticks are made with Canadian-raised bison (as well as beef), naturally fermented, and cold-smoked to perfection. No mystery meat. No lab-coat ingredients. Just real food that fuels you the way nature intended. Woman-Owned. Boldly-Run. BUFF isn’t backed by corporate buzzwords or..."

We want to create a waste free future.We believe that the technology exists to make our BHAG a reality, it just takes the right company with the right community to make these products the new normal.This is why we are developing products made of environmentally sensible materials. To educate and inspire the global community of people who are committed to making a positive impact on our planet.Put simply, we believe in better.Everyday Products Without Everyday Waste™ Origin Story This all started with Jeremy Lang, our founder. He saw first hand the damage plastic was doing to our oceans while on family vacation in Hawaii in 2008. Jeremy had the courage to spend years experimenting with new materials to try and find an alternative to plastic that could be used in everyday products I started Pela when my son Cole dug up some plastic on the beach in Hawaii and I started wondering about the impact of plastics on our planet.Our mission to make sustainable products the new normal starts with a product that you hold everyday. Phone cases help to protect your investment (phones are expensive!) but they shouldn't be just another plastic product made with materials that could carry toxins into your home.Our cases are tested to be free of BPA, lead, cadmium and phthalates. If we can make products at a higher standard to keep our family and planet safe, shouldn't we?I just want to make sure that I do my best to protect the planet (our home) for my children and their children and the future generations to come!\" — Jeremy Lang, Founder of Pela Loading video...

Instigators of change. We invented men’s pouch underwear nearly 20 years ago.And we’ve been changing men’s lives ever since. We confront the uncomfortable. We take on men’s intimate problems with boldness and tenacity. We fix them. And we deliver life-changing comfort and support.Men have been dealing with discomfort for decades. But it was SAXX’s founder, Trent Kitsch, who recognized men’s discomfort and innovated to solve it. In 2006, Trent Kitsch was on a fishing expedition and after spending hours in a cold, clammy ocean suit he knew there had to be a better way to protect his package from uncomfortable chafe.As a former baseball player, he imagined a catcher’s mitt hammock design turned upside down and built into his underwear. After the fishing trip, and with the hammock idea still percolating, he worked with a seamstress and designer — and himself as the fit model — to create a paneled fabric hammock that separated his balls from his legs. Fourteen prototypes later, the BallPark Pouch® and SAXX Underwear were ready to change men’s lives. It’s an imperfect world but here are some of the ways we commit to making it better.

    "brandStory": "Our Story Have you ever wondered why a pair of sunglasses costs as much as a weekend getaway?Yeah… me too. I didn’t question it much until early 2025, when I was packing for a golf trip. I reached into the bottom pocket of my bag and found my $300 sunglasses—now sporting a fresh, deep scratch courtesy of whatever junk accompanied it. It wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. And at that point, I had to ask myself:Why am I replacing expensive glasses that go out of style next year and I just perpetually destroy. I cursed the establishment, hoped on amazon and bought a pair of glasses that look decent under 50 buck. They arrived… and the quality matched the price. The lenses were terrible, the frames were flimsy, the fit was questionable at best. But here’s what really got me: they weren’t that different from the $300 pair.Same basic parts. Same hinges. Same weight.One was just priced like rent. After the trip (Mexico), and some recovery, I dug deeper. The Industry No One Talks About A few late-night rabbit holes later, I learned the truth: the eyewear industry is controlled by one mega company. All those “different” brands? The ones we grew up thinking were independent, cool, or local? All owned by the same corporation, no joke, its actually wild, ask chat gpt. Here you don’t even have to type it. “Tell me about the one company that owns the eyewear industry”. Wild eh? They control the design, distribution, manufacturing, retail—everything. And they inflate prices because they can. When you’re the only game in town, who’s going to stop you? Suddenly, the $300 price tag made a lot more sense. The Breakthrough Moment As my Amazon glasses expired and summer was approaching fast I continued to an off brand, high quality reasonably priced pair of glasses. One where if the style changed next year, or I destroyed them again I wouldn’t fee to bad about getting a new pair next year. Googling “Canadian eyewear brand”, notta. Actually, the only Canadian eyewear..."

    "brandStory": "Our Story Fourth-generation Syrian refugees bring centuries-old art of soap making to Calgary Abdulfatah Sabouni is a fourth generation soap maker. Making soap has been his family business for more than 125 years. Even his last name, Sabouni, means soap maker. The centuries-old tradition of Aleppo soap making — which uses no chemicals or other additives —involves secret family recipes handed down for generations. In the 11th century, the Crusaders brought Aleppo soap back to Europe, starting a centuries-long love affair with the olive-oil and laurel oil based soap said to be intensely moisturizing. Aleppo soap is thought to be one of the world’s oldest types of soap, and also said to have been the inspiration for the equally famous Marseille soap of France. Although claims of its great antiquity abound, such as references in the popular press to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and Queen Zenobia of Syria using Aleppo soap, these claims have yet to be verified by Scholarly method. Traditional soap factories in Aleppo were either destroyed or abandoned, creating a worldwide shortage of Aleppo soap. Newspaper headlines appeared in Europe, Saudi Arabia and Japan, where the soap is highly coveted. When Sabouni arrived in Calgary two years ago, his entrepreneurial dreams were never far from his thoughts. He threw himself into learning English and got the ball rolling, and opened Aleppo Savon to great success. The business continues to grow, and they have big plans for distribution across Canada and North America. For Sabouni, making the world-famous Aleppo soap is his way of giving back to a city and country that has given him and his family so much. <div id='ndrsl-wol-5fb60d339cf2854b761806dd' class='ndrsl-widget'></div> Founder and Owner of Aleppo Savon and His Family Officially Become Canadian Citizens After coming to Canada in 2016 to escape the Syrian war and provide a better life for his family, owner and founder Abdulfatah and his family become official Canadian citizens o..."

These guiding principles have led Nutrience to providing dogs and cats with complete and balanced diets for over 30 years. Proper nourishment has been at the core of Nutrience’s philosophy and continues to fuel its innovation. All Nutrience formulas meet the nutritional standards set by AAFCO with ingredients that are humanely raised and sustainably harvested. Here at Nutrience, we believe that a healthy lifestyle begins in the bowl. Produced in Canada Crafted in small batches in our very own kitchen located in British Columbia, Canada, Nutrience formulas are made with locally sourced proteins, fruits, and vegetables. Our 9.98 million square kilometers of endless lakes, rivers and forests stretching from the Maritimes to the British Columbia coasts provide us with some of the best raw ingredients for our dog and cat foods and treats. We take great pride in sourcing fresh poultry, meats, wild-caught fish, and produce directly from Canadian farmers, ranchers and fishermen –chicken and turkey from Fraser Valley; beef and bison from the Prairies; or any of the wild-caught fish that is plentiful in the cold, clear waters of the Pacific Northwest.

    "brandStory": "Our Story From a young age, I began asking questions about food. What was in it? What was its environmental impact, where did it come from, how was it made, and, most importantly, was it nourishing? Just because the foods I had eaten were commonly accepted and consumed, did that mean they should continue to be? After all, what is the point of food if it does not provide nourishment on a fundamental level? Can’t we just eat real food? I am far from alone. Thankfully, more and more people have also been concerned about our food as our health becomes more of a priority. Unfortunately, the food industry does not always address these concerns and continues to churn out products with minimal improvements dressed up in marketing claims and campaigns to distract from the truly meaningful changes that are needed. While I was a ballet dancer in California, I developed a deeper desire to understand how food impacts our bodies. I was already a vegetarian and loved learning about new ways of eating and culinary techniques. I was exposed to the raw vegan diet and I fell in love with its sorcery. Raw produce was turned into flavourful dishes like pastas, crackers, sauces and desserts. It was like magic! NUDFUDNUDFUDNUDFUD After my ballet career was ended by injury, I returned home to Canada and continued to explore my passion for holistic nutrition and the culinary arts. As I continued to fine-tune what I ate and experimented with different ways of cooking and eating, I developed a deep connection to the environment and animals and also felt better than I ever had before. Because I was so passionate about real, wholesome food, I realized there were not many products on the market that met these standards. The more and more research I did on packaged foods, the more I was shocked by what was being passed off as “food”. As a result, I was inspired to make my own food products that were honest and derived from whole, simple ingredients that made people feel good because that’s what I..."

    "brandStory": "How the Magic Works Authentic, Guilt-Free TasteAt Fiber Gourmet we use 100% wheat in our products which is why they taste just like the unhealthy alternatives, giving you the same delicious taste and texture you know and love. How do we pull this off? Over 90% of the calories in wheat flour come from its starch. Starch molecules are really long chains of sugars. Enzymes in your body release sugars from the starch during digestion, sending the sugar into your bloodstream and throughout to your body.With a few subtle alterations to the starch, we can make it a lot harder for the enzymes in your body to release the sugar, keeping them locked away and out of your body. This stops you from getting the blood sugar spike (and crash) that you typically get from a carb-heavy meal, and effectively converts the bloated calorie-packed starch into a lean calorie-free fiber. By making our pasta out of a mix of this improved starch (now called modified wheat starch) and the original protein from the flour (vital wheat gluten), we can increase protein and fiber while reducing net carbs and calories.Low Net Carb and Low Calorie:Less than HALF THE NET CARBS and approximately HALF THE CALORIES than the leading brand. Enjoy everything you want in a great plate of pasta, rice pilaf, or flour product with less of what you don’t! Beneficial Fiber:Our fiber packed products keep you fuller for longer without causing bloating, while also producing butyric acid, which has many health benefits. Great flavor and great nutritional benefits can finally meet! See more details below. Trailblazers in the industry The Fiber Gourmet Mission is to welcome you back to the foods you love. Since 2007, we’ve been reinventing your favorite foods with fewer carbs and calories, without sacrificing flavor or texture, using our patented formula.

Fizz is a different kind of mobile provider that was launched in 2018 by Videotron, a long-standing company that’s been partnering with other major telecom companies for over 60 years, working to offer a reliable mobile network across Canada. Testimonials and awards What we’re all about The Fizz difference Where to find us The idea behind Fizz is to shake up the Canadian telecom industry by doing things differently. With our 100% online business model, members are in the driver’s seat with direct access to their account to subscribe, modify their plan, redeem rewards, refer friends and more, whenever they want.

Our members rave about what sets Fizz apart, and we’ve racked up some pretty neat awards over the years. Affordable Carrier – Fizz I’ve been using Fizz Mobile for over a year now. I live in the GTA and have never experienced any network issues. US roaming is quite impressive, with no network blackouts. Using Fizz is fun—it offers data rollover, data gifting, perks, rewards, and unlimited referrals. Whenever the network signal is weak, it automatically switches to one of the big three carriers. I haven’t experienced any dropped calls. It’s easy to change your plan month to month, and you can choose only the features you want. While other networks also offer affordable plans, Fizz stands out for its flexibility. Suree, 2025-05-06 Best Supplier I have been subscribed to Fizz for almost a year, and I’m very happy to have chosen this mobile provider.

Our safe, sustainable, and so sweet baby goods are made to last (and love). Designed with durability and functionality in mind, our products are tried and tested by parents like you. That means you can be confident they will hold up, no matter what life (or baby) throws at them. Our commitment to the highest safety and sustainability standards and family-first focus means you can feel good about everything you find here.

We’ve continued expanding, but stayed committed to quality and accessibility. All of our products are ASTM, CPSC and CPSIA compliant, because every little one—and parent—deserves the best. Featured in Milestone Moments2015: Our Magical BeginningWe're fearless pioneers, always willing to try new things in pursuit of better, cuter, and safer products. We launched our first product out of our home office with help from our husbands. Milestone Moments2016: Out On Our OwnWe moved from an Etsy shop to our own website, attended our first trade show, started selling to boutiques, and expanded our offering to include our first muslin swaddles.

Petits Genoux began as a happy accident in between drop off and pick up at preschool, between another mom and I. A super stylish travel writer and myself, creating pieces for our #newprojects. In a few months we had a line and a few weeks later, an order and then voila, Petits Genoux was born. No plan, no bank account, no website, but we pulled it together and had an opening in our first vendors boutique and I was right back into the swing of things. A vast new, shiny space called Childrens Clothing was breathing a new vibrant energy into me. The entrepreneurial spirit is a bit of a phenomenon to some. They question the struggle, the inconsistencies, the highs and deep lows. Those are the things that keep me in it, it’s like survivor or the amazing race, non-stop and never ending. I am a creator, and and don’t think I will ever stop.

    "brandStory": "Our Story We’ve been around for a while, and that’s a good thing The Bean was born in an era when we still listened to cassettes in our cafés. More importantly, it was also the era of Vancouver’s “second-wave” coffee boom. West Coast coffee culture is thriving, but it’s also relatively new – since we opened our flagship store in West Vancouver during B.C.’s coffee awakening in the ‘90s, we like to think we’re among “the originals”. We’re about good people and good coffee Since the beginning, we sought out the best beans and the best people that the coffee industry had to offer. People seem to appreciate that, and we’ve been growing ever since. In 1994, we opened up our roastery, which allowed us to provide that iconic Bean Around the World taste to an increasing number of shops. We’ve now got 23 locations around the Lower Mainland and a bounty of loyal coffee subscribers who get their beans by delivery."

We weren’t just buying beans — we were aligning on a vision. To build something better. Something healthier. Something delicious.We founded Two Bears because we saw a gap in the market: high-quality, great-tasting drinks that actually do something for you. No added sugar. Real ingredients. Packed with protein. Convenient for real life.But more than that, we created Two Bears to prove that you don’t have to choose between health and taste. You can have both — and look good doing it.We’re proudly Canadian. Fueled by nature. Ferocious about crafting drinks that raise the bar.To us, “ferocious” means chasing what lights you up — whether it’s coffee, adventure, or building a life that makes you feel alive.So whatever you’re into, be bold.

He truly puts his heart and then some into everything he does. Thanks for keeping us above average, Joe.

I’d get my smoothies from cafes near me but they were always packed with added sugar and unhealthy ingredients that left me feeling bloated and tired. So, my partners and I joined forces with a mission: to solve this smoothie dilemma for busy folks like me. Our solution? Frozen, pre-portioned smoothies that are not just tasty and packed with goodness, but also ready in seconds. NOUR KAISS, CO-FOUNDER + CMO “ Empowering people to build healthy eating habits Smoothies that are good for you and the environment Making healthy food accessible to everyone Always balancing taste and nutrition IT ALL STARTS FROM WITHIN What you put inside your body matters From the very beginning, our mission has centered around the profound impact of your food choices on your well-being and performance. That’s precisely why we’ve dedicated ourselves to crafting smoothies composed of the finest, vitamin-rich ingredients. Our goal is simple: to transform your life for the better with every sip. We don’t eat enough fruits & veggies According to the CDC, a mere one in ten individuals manages to meet the daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. At our core, we’re committed to making it effortless and convenient for you to embrace a broader spectrum of superfoods through our perfectly portioned smoothies. Frozen to lock in the good stuff Right from the start, our vision was crystal clear – we were going to craft our smoothies using frozen ingredients. Why the emphasis on frozen? Well, it all boils down to the supply chain. You see, the path that fresh produce takes from the farm to your table spans weeks, and during that time, fruits and veggies can lose over 30% of their nutritional goodness just three days after being harvested. By freezing produce right at the source, we lock in those essential nutrients and flavors, ensuring that every sip of our smoothies maximizes t..."

    "brandStory": "Share Link We recently shared some of the science behind sweat and electrolyte loss, highlighting the necessity and importance of replenishing key electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride) after physical activity and exercise. Having a clear understanding of how we lose electrolytes was crucial when it came to formulating our own, and though we found that most electrolytes were lost through sweat, there was another contender: drinking alcohol. We had heard about the correlation between drinking alcohol and electrolyte loss before, but wondered how could we be losing electrolytes just by consuming a liquid? Is there any truth to the claims that electrolytes are a great hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking? The truth is, alcohol, regardless of its type, has a major impact on the absorption, elimination, efficacy, and concentration of essential electrolytes and minerals within the body. As a diuretic, alcohol consumption triggers diuresis, a condition characterized by increased urine output, and tricks our kidneys into flushing out water by blocking the release of natural hormones needed to control fluid and electrolyte levels. Generally speaking, the intensity of alcohols diuretic effect is largely determined by the strength of the alcohol consumed. This means that spirits with a higher alcohol content like vodka, whisky, and rum dehydrate us faster than drinks with a lower alcohol content like beer, coolers, and wine. However, drinks with a lower alcohol content tend to be consumed in greater volumes, and can quickly add up to have the same dehydrating effect that would occur when consuming a stronger alcohol. The more alcohol we consume, the more likely we are to experience its dehydrating effect, often being left with a headache, feeling tired, thirsty, nauseous, irritable, or in other words, hungover. Though hangovers may seem like an inevitable outcome of drinking alcohol, the truth is we can easily fight back by keeping ourselves hy..."

We were first with melatonin, first with glucosamine and first to bring science-backed integrity to the supplement aisle. When new Health Canada rules emerged, we didn’t just adapt—we helped build the framework. Working alongside regulators, we shaped the NPN system and set the gold-standard regulations still used today. 2010s From Family Business to Fan Favourite Embracing the digital age, we launched some of our most well-known products including collagen and bone broth and introduced our natural wellness to a devoted fan following. Our small supplement business quickly became a trusted Canadian wellness partner and we’ve been growing ever since. 2020s Onward, Together From pandemic pivots to becoming Canada’s #1 in collagen, bone broth and spirulina, Organika has continued to innovate—introducing countless new products while staying true to our mission: helping people live healthier, every step of the way. 1980s A Remedy, A Revelation Our founder discovered the power of natural healing through their own homemade remedies and never looked back. 1990s–2000s Wellness in a Bottle From launching with just four products to earning a Good Manufa..."

If you've worn glasses for years, chances are, you have purchased one of the brands (Rayban, Prada, Oakley) or shopped at one of its retailers (Lenscrafters, Sunglass Hut, Clearly, Eyebuydirect ....). We believe that we can do better than that. We can offer options. Real options. In 2012, we launched iLookGlasses.ca with one goal in mind: bringing premium-quality eyewear directly to Canadian consumers at accessible prices. How? We do so by cutting out the middleman and sourcing directly from independent frame & lens manufacturers. We do not run costly TV advertising campaigns or high-profile sponsorship programs. We do not have high overhead costs associated with running brick-and-mortar stores. By maintaining a lean and mean operation, we are able to offer competitive pricing and pass the savings directly onto our customers. What about quality? We uphold consistency in quality by developing and maintaining long-term partnerships with our suppliers. We stand behind our products with a one-year warranty program. We are confident that our customers will be happy with their purchases and come back to us when they look for their next pair of glasses. How about style? Do I get more style with designer frames? Well, don't take our words for it and have a look for yourself! We offer a wide variety of styles, from classic, everyday, retro to high fashion. Instead of having one pair of expensive designer glasses, you could own several pairs from iLookGlasses and have some fun switching things up. Everyone else will think that you paid much more than you actually did! Sounds good to you? We look forward to hearing from you! Your Stories I am very impressed with this company. I just received my three pairs of glasses and I was so nervous. This is the first time I ordered prescription glasses on ..."

    "brandStory": "Sisters Myriam and Romy are the founders of Maguire, an independent, direct-to-consumer fashion footwear company. With no connections in the fashion industry, Myriam and Romy’s entrepreneurial journey was propelled by sheer determination and grit. It all started with a desire to make high-quality shoes accessible for more people: “Everywhere we shopped, it was always a choice between quality or affordability,” the sisters recall. “I worked in fast fashion [as a designer for white-label brands],” says Myriam, President and Lead Designer. “I saw the way things were done: there are a lot of middle-men in the industry, driving up margins. I thought there could be a way to offer better products at better prices.” Myriam was always interested in footwear design, having obtained a Footwear Diploma at the prestigious Cordwainer’s College in London. Before founding Maguire, she would work at United Colours of Benetton in Treviso, Pajar and the Aldo Group in Montréal, and design for dozens of white-label clients including Opening Ceremony, Target, and Kohls. Romy, for her part, is no stranger to the world, having lived in Vancouver, Paris, and Sydney. A communications major with diverse interests, she worked with creative agencies and film festivals before joining her sister in the venture. As head of Operations and Marketing at Maguire, she brings a multidisciplinary approach and a fresh perspective to an age-old industry. The duo launched Maguire online in 2017 with a single product and $15k. Only five years later, Maguire has more than twenty employees and is incorporated in two countries with stores in Montréal, Toronto, and New York City. They have been featured in Forbes, WWD, Elle, and Bazaar, and won the Emerging Talent Award for Accessories at the Canadian Fashion Awards in 2022. Still proudly independent, Myriam and her sister Romy continue to grow their mission to bring transparency, quality and fair prices to women’s footwear. More news Maguire Shoes Careers - Rea..."

    "brandStory": "BROYA’S STORY STARTS WITH MINE. Growing up, I had some health issues that impacted my life, but never bad enough to search for a diagnoses. But by the time I was 20 years old, I had a laundry list of foods I could or could not eat based on how they made my gut feel.It was a miserable feeling, knowing that if I ate the wrong thing I’d feel bloated, lethargic, and could barely think straight.When I was 22, I started to connect the dots that my digestion sensitivities were due to an imbalance in my gut. That's when I took a deep dive into food and nutrition, doing everything I could to learn how to heal from the inside out. ALL SIGNS POINTED TO THE BENEFITS OF BONE BROTH. At this point, I was in touch with a local farmer and had purchased half of a grass-fed cow. I grabbed three coolers and drove two hours to pick it up, ready to pack my freezer with high quality cuts of meat.What I didn't know was that with half a cow comes around 100 lbs of bones; giving me the perfect opportunity to simmer my first batch of bone broth. Bone Broth Benefits Promotes Youthful Skin Aid Digestion & Supports Gut Health Supports a Good Nights Sleep Helps Reduce Cravings Supports A Healthy Immune System I WAS HOOKED. From that day forward, I’ve drank two cups of broth a day; once in the morning before my coffee and then in the afternoon to fend off the afternoon slump.Slowly, I noticed the difference in my gut, mood, and especially my energy. Every time I had a cup of broth, I felt like Super Mario after chowing down on a magical mushroom. I KNEW I HAD TO SHARE THIS FEELING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. So in 2015, I started putting together the pieces of Broya - and choosing a supplier was my first big step. I knew I wanted to make an impact in thousands of lives, so I reached out to a few streamline suppliers who I thought could help me reach that goal.But the more I dug into the meat industry, the more I learned how disgusting industrial farms were and how detrimental choosing one would be..."

This means 100% natural products, full of medicinal organics and completely free of cortisone, steroids, DEA (diethanolamine), sulfates, salt (sodium chloride), propylene glycol, aluminum, synthetic fragrances, and dyes. With a constantly increasing awareness of the potentially harmful chemical and synthetic ingredients used in health and beauty products, it is becoming more apparent that safer, naturally derived and organic alternatives should be made available. Many synthetic ingredients, such as those noted above, are potentially harmful chemicals used in most beauty related products available on the common market today. They are inexpensive and make the products appear richer in quality by providing either foam enhancing, thickening or moisture retaining properties to the product. These ingredients have undergone extensive testing and many are now recognized as potentially harmful to human health or the environment. They can be absorbed through the skin and into the blood stream and may eventually accumulate in various organs of the body. At Carina, we have chosen a healthier approach to manufacturing self-care products. Since Carina's inception in 1972, replacing chemical and synthetic ingredients with natural and organic plant extracts, essences, and oils has been central to our focus and philosophy. This simple formula has helped Carina and its products become recognized and preferred internationally. Certified organic, entirely natural and synthetic-free ingredients provide our shampoo products with mild, yet effective, cleansing properties and the foam produced is rich and creamy. This is due to the essential tree, herb, fruit and flower extracts that are added to complement our formulations. In our skin creams and conditioners, organic essences and oils from avocado, olive, flax seed, pumpkin seed and sunflower help the skin to naturally retain and maintain its moisture level and h..."

Our local quest for a refreshing ready-to-drink margarita and paloma was inspired by the desire for a tropical escape in the midst of a challenging season staying home. At the time, we struggled to find local options that tasted like the real deal without being full of sugar and artificial flavours. We knew then that the only way to satisfy our craving for a crisp and refreshing tequila cocktail was to craft one ourselves using premium ingredients! TURNS OUT, WE WEREN'T ALONE. Our journey to create something totally unique was also driven by other margarita and paloma lovers who were feeling the same way. By combining the vision of a premium cocktail brand with a year-long adventure of perfecting recipes, Olé Cocktails Co. was born! Perfectly balanced and crafted with care, our cocktails are made with premium quality blue weber agave tequila from Jalisco, México, real fruit juices, organic agave nectar, and a delectable pinch of sea salt. Irresistible taste with no artificial colours, flavours, or sweeteners. Just one sip will leave you with a crisp, clean finish and a light sparkle.

Sourcing legal orange blossom and rose essential oil crops freed Afghan farmers from the illegal poppy crop and liberated their daughters from becoming young opium brides. I’ve taken my philosophy of equality and empowerment around the world to Haiti, Rwanda, The Middle East, India, and Madagascar. Because it’s the right thing to do. This is our story today Today, we have evolved into an aromatherapy clean perfume brand that sources sustainable oils as well as upcycled oils. Our focus on truly ending war is by empowering girls and women by ending period poverty at home and around the world. We have partnered with Days for Girls and Charity Water. Share how The 7 Virtues social enterprise is a sustainable beauty brand? Empowering others is in the DNA of our brand, it’s the why behind why I set out on this journey to give dignity and jobs to others. We walk our talk.

I loved the simple things people were doing in their daily lives to be more environmentally conscious and I quickly began to adopt this \"new\" way of life.After 7 years, my husband and I decided to move back to Canada with our young family. I knew life in Canada was going to be much different than what I had become accustom to in Europe, but I was feeling inspired and excited to bring some of that lifestyle home with me.I had caught the entrepreneurial bug around that time and was actively looking to start my own business. But it had to be something that I could truly feel passionate and good about... SHOP OUR COLLECTIONS THE BARE HOME IS BORN.At first, the Bare Home was more than cleaning products. I was offering a variety of fair trade foods and other zero waste products. However, I quickly noticed that customers were most interested in the refilling options for my laundry and cleaning products. So I began to pivot my focus towards cleaning products and even went as far as having customers leave their empty bottles on their doorstep and I was driving around refilling them!It was clear that people loved the idea that they could have one bottle and simply refill it. They wanted the convenience without the waste.They're looking for a better option and I was ready to come up with a solution. THE BARE HOME 2.0After months of design and development, I launched a full line of cleaning products along with a unique 3 liter and 10 liter at-home refill station and in-store refill station.When creating the collection, my two priorities were to create products that were effective and clean for the environment. This meant that all of the products would be biodegradable, phosphate free, and dye free. Never tested on animals and only scented with high quality essential oils.

We fight the big guys all the time. The Tim Hortons and the Starbucks of the world. It’s tough to be an Aboriginal company in a commodity driven market. Tough to get people believing in you. But once they do, they’re fiercely loyal. Now, we have over 50 resorts countrywide on our books.”Biglin says he gets to travel from coast to coast to meet with different communities. “I meet Cree, Blackfoot, Mohawk people. What I’m learning is amazing. If you’re open minded enough to experience what’s out there, you’ll find we live in an amazing country.

Born in 1988 in White Rock, B.C., Scott is a member of the Nlaka’pamux Nation, whose territory is located in the interior of present-day British Columbia, with Sts’ailes and British ancestry. Growing up, Scott immersed himself in North American and European fashion culture, obsessively flipping through magazines and watching the iconic Canadian television series, Fashion File. The designers he looked up to created garments that were fantastical and other-worldly, offering a window through which he could envision an alternative, seemingly unattainable way of life. Following a brief period of enrollment at a local college for horticultural studies, and realizing his love for fashion, Scott left school with a curious, open mind and devised a plan to pursue his dream of designing clothes. It wasn’t until he began assembling his first portfolio application that Scott taught himself to sew. In 2011 he attended Ryerson University, where he would later receive a Bachelor of Design in Fashion. He received an educational sponsorship from his Band and is a two-time bursary recipient of Indspire. After graduating from Ryerson, Scott interned for esteemed Canadian designers Jeremy Laing and Comrags, where he credits receiving his formal training. Scott’s debut collection, Sissy, took place as part of the inaugural Indigenous Fashion Arts Festival in Toronto, founded by Indigenous artist and innovator, Sage Paul. His collection bridges the Western concept of luxury fashion with his ancestral worldview on ethics, craft, and aesthetic sensibility, representing a distinct contribution to a genuine Canadian fashion. Scott’s approach to design pictures a modern image of fashion through an Indigenous lens. The Sissy woman is cute, fluid, and enviable, representing a vision of girlishness and familial sisterhood. Scott lives and works in Toronto."

It's our mission to kindly craft items that light up your life, inspire a connection & are safe for you, your family, your pets, and the environment. Meet Salina: Boozhoo! Hello! I am Salina - owner and maker at Alice + Sage. I am Anishinaabe (bear clan) and Ukrainian, and a member of Lake St. Martin First Nation. Growing up on Treaty 2 Territory in St. Martin, Manitoba and spending so much time outdoors, I've always had a deep love and connection with nature, animals, and spirit. Ever since I was a little girl I was drawn to the mountains and ocean. I moved to Vancouver, BC in 2010 and then to Abbotsford in the Fraser Valley in 2021 before finally making my way home to Manitoba in 2024. I spent the majority of those years working in mental health and addiction - supporting folks in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. That's also when I really began my own journey of healing and learning how to connect to my spirit, and how essential self-care/love is to our entire well-being. One of the questions I'm always asked is, “Why did you start making candles?” Like so many of my ideas - it came to me in a dream. First I had a dream of making candles, and then I had another dream of making specifically soy candles and calling my business Alice + Sage. My grandmother on my dad's side was named Alice, and she is who all of my aunties say I get my dimples from. I also have a cat named Sir Alice. He’s the big cutie you see from time to time who likes to supervise me while I make my candle creations. Everything about ALICE really just represents love - one of our sacred teachings. As for SAGE... it represents wisdom; another one of our Seven Sacred Teachings. It’s about taking time. Slowing down. Practicing patience. Bei..."

Satya was first started out of my small, $15 crockpot — not because I had big business dreams or a desire to be an entrepreneur, but because of a real need.My baby girl, Esme, was scratching her arms and legs bloody. The doctor diagnosed her with eczema and prescribed a topical steroid. Overwhelmed by the scientific-based evidence of the side effects of steroid creams, I knew there had to be a better solution.I wanted something effective, non-toxic, and fragrance-free, backed by scientifically supported research. But to my disappointment, I couldn't find a single product that could safely heal her skin. Seeing my daughter in pain was the absolute worst feeling in the world. I decided to take matters into my own hands.For nights, I used my investigative skills as a journalist and dug into traditional medicine, medical research, and the latest academic studies coming out of universities, desperate to find a solution. I began experimenting in my kitchen with nothing more than a crockpot and the best organic ingredients I could find.Voila! There it was. I created a balm that would clear Esme's eczema up within two days. JUST LIKE THAT, MY SECOND BABY, SATYA ORGANIC, WAS BORN! I never intended to become a business owner, but after having so many moms drive hours to try my formula, I knew this was my way of creating change. As a mom, I knew that I couldn't be the only one struggling to find clean and effective skincare for my family that actually does what it says it does.I want every parent, partner, or friend to be able to access safe skin relief for their loved ones. I want every eczema warrior in the world to get back to doing what they love most without the feeling of discomfort in their skin, or the painful, long-term effects..."

    "brandStory": "+ABOUT △ ABOUT INNER WOLF JEWELRY △ Inner Wolf Jewelry is owned and operated independently by Ashya Elizabeth. Creating from her studio in so-called Vancouver, Ashya’s work is influenced by her Cree and Turkish ancestry, every piece infused with elemental components of the natural and spiritual world. Ashya has allowed her ancestral lines to remain one of the greatest influences in the art she creates. Holding onto a deep connection with the earth, animals and minerals, Ashya incorporates this in her work through primarily using raw stones as well as hair, quills and feathers. Whether using antler sheds or feathers sourced from elders, every gift from the animals is humanely sourced, honored and respected. Growing up with an influential, intelligent and culturally connected mother, Ashya was immersed in ancestral knowledge, cultural history and an informed perspective on historical and contemporary Indigenous issues. Guided by her aunties and other family members, Ashya made her first dreamcatcher at the age of eight. This passion for creating has been instilled in her from a young age, passed down through familial relationships and braided into her work today. Ashya studied at the University of Saskatchewan, exploring lithography, printmaking, painting and art history. This education provided a structured foundation for her to work from, eventually evolving into the practice of jewelry making. Acting as a conduit, Ashya draws on ancestral and cultural teachings to create pieces that tell a story. As she evolves in learning new techniques, she always returns to a place of gratitude for the support she receives. Her business is based on the primary values of honesty, authenticity and affordability. Ashya believes that being adorned and made to feel beautiful should be accessible, regardless of your budget. Her materials are ethically sourced and she is proud to be able to share these pieces of her culture with the world. You can find Ashya’s work in a number of small..."

Forever struck by the resilience of people with disabilities and the barriers they face, it was Holly's goal to raise $500 in Milk Jar’s first year for programs that support learning and growth.

Our story officially began in 1983, when Barry Lammle saw an opportunity in the retail market for a company to carry the top brands in western wear all under one roof. A rancher first, from De Winton, Alberta – Barry’s retail experience and expertise stemmed from decades working at the Hudson’s Bay Company. Throughout this journey, Barry studied what his customers valued most, and used the knowledge he gained to establish the Lammle’s Western Wear brand in 1983. The mission was clear: Address the needs of everyday Albertans looking for a western retailer that provides the best service, selection, and quality. This led to the opening of the first Lammle’s Western Wear store in our hometown of Calgary, Alberta. Over the next forty years, Lammle’s grew to have over 20 stores across Western Canada while continuing to serve those wanting the latest top-name brands in boots, hats, western clothing and accessories for their entire family. Business milestones include Lammle’s exclusive partnership with the Calgary Stampede, which welcomes visitors from across the globe as they arrive on our western doorsteps. To reach customers who may not have access to a physical location, Lammle’s launched an online store which has helped make the company a national brand, and enabled Lammle’s to serve customers fromcoast to coast. Today, Barry and his eldest son Jeff continue to keep the Lammle’s Experience focused on the needs of the customers through exceptional service, wide selection and quality products. As the leading western lifestyle retailer in Canada, we’re proud to offer an authentic lifestyle experience that welcomes everyone.

Whether you're chasing PRs, leveling up your fitness, or just looking to feel great, we’ve got your back. Our Story ANS Performance started as a passion project between two lifelong athletes who wanted to shake up the supplement industry—blending real science with real performance to create something different. Nick and Shetal first crossed paths back in 2006 while working in the pharmaceutical industry. Shetal, a chemical engineer, and Nick, a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry, ran the R&D lab for the Canadian division of a multi-billion-dollar global pharma company. Nick eventually dove into the world of sports nutrition, spending five years consulting for some of the biggest supplement brands and helping launch hundreds of products worldwide. But he knew there was still something missing—a brand that put science and quality first. In 2012, Nick and Shetal teamed up again to bring that vision to life. ANS Performance was born. The name stands for Advanced Nutraceutical Sciences, and that’s exactly what they set out to deliver—clean, high-performance supplements with no gimmicks, just results. Product Quality that is Second to None! At ANS Performance, we’re all about quality, innovation, and results. We carefully select every ingredient and work closely with all our suppliers to ensure they meet the highest standards—so you can perform at your best, no matter your goal. All our products are made in cGMP-certified facilities, approved by Health Canada and/or the US FDA, guaranteeing top-tier safety and qualit..."

Then we make delicious & healthy products like cold-pressed juices and more. Even our leftover pulp gets repurposed! Our Story This whole grand adventure began on a Ferris wheel where our first \"date\" took place. We stayed there for hours, talking and envisioning a better world. We barely knew each other, but after that brief moment, we knew that with our shared passion for food and the environment, we had to start a project together. A project that would make a positive impact on the world.At the same time, we received a call from Fred at Courchesne Larose, the largest fruit and vegetable distributor in Canada. He was looking for a solution for the 16 to 20 tons of food they were losing every day. After visiting their warehouse and quickly discovering why these perfectly good fruits and vegetables were ending up in a landfill, the three of us promised to immediately get to work and find a solution. The stars were aligned, and the dream team was born.To tackle such a global challenge, we had no choice but to set our goals high. From day one, the vision was clear: to become the global leader in the circular economy within the food industry and to inspire new business practices by placing our mission, commitment, and our values at the heart of all our decisions. It is this vision that still motivates us every day, and we won't stop until food waste is eradicated from the face of the earth. That's our promise.Thank you for being here with us, and thank you for participating in our mission—you all contribute to something grand, and we will be eternally grateful to you.David, Julie & Fred — LOOP Mission Founders OUR RESCUE MISSION Nobody likes to be rejected, not even food.

But at the time we couldn’t find a food that prioritized animal welfare, sustainability and transparency standards. We wanted to provide our own pets with premium nutrition that came from ingredients that were grown and raised the right way. We realized that a pet food with these standards didn’t exist, and saw an opportunity to create it ourselves. For us that meant sourcing the highest quality ingredients, supporting farmers who treat their animals right, respecting the environment, and providing full transparency to our customers. It’s out of that vision that Open Farm was born – from the simple idea that pet food can be good for your pet and Do Some Good, all at the same time. Our Standards Premium nutrition With the most nutritious ingredients, our recipes are created to meet your pet’s unique needs.

But once I saw how broken the skincare industry really was, I couldn’t walk away. I had to fix it. I had to build something women could trust completely.Everything we do still comes from that place—protecting what matters most. And I’m so honoured you’re here.Each formula we create is designed with the same level of care I give my own family. If it’s not safe for me and my kids, it doesn’t make it into our line. I built this brand because I couldn’t find anything that met my standards—and now, I make sure you don’t have to compromise either. The migraineswere unbearable.For years, Michelle suffered without knowing why. The pain disrupted her life—but it wasn’t until her first pregnancy in 2008 that she started asking deeper questions.What was she eating? What was she using on her skin? On her family?She learned the truth the hard way: her body was reacting to toxins hidden in everyday products.Gluten was one of her biggest problems—but it wasn’t the only one.That discovery set off a chain reaction. She changed everything her family put in and on their bodies. What Other Skincare Brands Don't Want You To KnowMichelle immersed herself in the science of clean living and healthy skin.However, what she discovered within the skincare industry was even more disturbing than she had expected.Behind the beautiful packaging and trendy “natural” claims were:Harmful synthetics and irritating fragrances Formulas linked to hormone disruption, fertility issues, and even cancer Brands that told partial truths to create a false sense of safetyShe realized that most skincare brands were not built by people who truly understood the ingredients. They were built by people who outsourced everything, then wrapped it in a good story.This wasn’t just misleading. It was unethical.

Odd Bunch was created to overcome these critical issues — making fresh produce accessible to families & individuals, while tackling food waste head-on.Founded in 2017 in London, Ontario, Odd Bunch is proudly Canadian. Our mission is simple: reduce food waste and ensure fruits & vegetables are affordable for households across the country. Approximately 50% of all food produced in Canada is wasted. Grocery stores have strict cosmetic standards and anything that looks or feels a little different is rejected or dumped. Too Big? Too Small? Asymmetrical? No problem!We work with farms, greenhouses, and distributors to rescue this surplus and “odd” produce—fruits & vegetables that are just as fresh and high quality, but don’t meet arbitrary cosmetic standards.But we don’t stop there. To keep prices low and pass even more savings on to you, we strategically source our produce, working with Canadian farmers as much as possible year round and offsetting high import tariffs by recovering food that would otherwise be wasted. This means you get top-quality produce at up to 50% less than grocery store prices—all while supporting local agriculture and reducing food waste.Why Choose Odd Bunch?Save Money While Reducing Waste – Get fresh, locally sourced produce for a fraction of grocery store prices.Sourced Smarter, Priced Fairer – We partner with Canadian farms first, but when certain fruits & vegetables aren’t grown locally, we rescue surplus imports, ensuring quality without the high cost.Convenient Weekly Deliveries – Skip the grocery store with a flexible subscription that brings a curated selection of fresh fruits & vegetables straight to your doorstep.Support a Canadian Business That Cares – Every Odd Bunch box helps rescue surplus food, supports local farmers, and lowers the carbon footprint generated by food waste.We’re not just fighting food waste—we’r..."

Add artificial flavouring and sweeteners to mask the bland flavour. Use smaller tea particles.“The focus group report is back - they don’t notice the difference.” But I did. As an executive at one of Canada’s largest coffee and tea brands, I watched something sacred turn synthetic, one quarter at a time. The so-called 'wellness' blends on shelves were months old - lifeless dust trapped in plastic sachets that leached microplastics and bleach into every 'healthy' cup.That winter, sick with the flu and craving my mother’s herbal remedy from India, I desperately tried every box on the grocery store shelf. Not one helped.Wrapped in a blanket, throat burning, eyes tearing up, I whispered - “Enough.”So I quit answering my Zoom calls and started blending with my hands.Turmeric stained my countertops gold.Steam fogged the windows.The entire house smelled like cardamom, chamomile, and stubborn hope.Three years. 170 blends.Red-eyed nights studying Ayurveda and traditional medicine until dawn.When friends began begging for refills - calling our teas 'magic' - I knew we’d found it.That’s how EQ State began: not to sell tea, but to restore its soul.

Sunil’s son, Sid, who had spent many summer breaks on the factory floor joined the family business full-time in 2008. Seeing the economic shift toward online sales, Sid led the company to open e-commerce stores on Amazon, eBay, and eventually greatsox.com. His sister, Priyanka, joined the company in 2015 and opened the first retail store in Danforth, Toronto, soon followed by two more Toronto locations, as well as a Cambridge location. The company, which originally focused on customer sport and pattern dress and casual socks, now offers a greatly expanded line boasting its traditional premium quality products with a guaranteed comfortable fit. Today, The Great Canadian Sox Company manufactures both custom private label as well as their house brands – J.B. Field’s and Vagden. The company, as a family business, is passionate about promoting outdoor lifestyles through walking, hiking, biking, running, mountaineering, and skiing/snowboarding. They know that cold weather and poor quality socks should never stop customers from leading healthy lifestyles or enjoying the great outdoors. To ensure customers’ feet stay comfortable in the harshest conditions, The Great Canadian Sox Company uses only the highest quality materials manufactured with cutting edge technical features like reinforced heels and toes, arch and ankle support, as well as double cuff and ribbing. With the mission to get people outside to enjoy nature, The Great Canadian Sox Company has..."

Founded in 2002 by Michaelee Lazore who is Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) from Akwesáhsne and Northern Paiute from Nevada. The design, production, and packaging of all the products is done in the working studio locally. In order to keep the next seven generations in mind, the production is sustainable and ingredients are ethically sourced.Sequoia has come a long way from its humble beginnings in Michaelee's kitchen. When Michaelee first started out, she was also working as an engineer designing roads, sewers and ditches. Her passion for creating beautiful soaps drove her to quit her day job as an engineer. Now Sequoia serves customers all over the world with their Indigenous inspired products. A note from Michaelee When choosing a name for my company, I fell in love with the name Sequoia. To me, it not only represented nature, but also strength. The giant Sequoia trees can live 2,000 to 3,000 years. The name also has a native connection as well. It's the name of the Cherokee chief who developed their alphabet so that the language could be written. A technical minded person just like me!One of the main reasons I started Sequoia was because I couldn't find any products that were not only made locally, but made by an Indigenous company. Scents such as Sweetgrass, Cedar, Sage were not commonplace back then, and those were some of my favorites I could not find anywhere. My Inspiration I have been inspired my entire life by my grandmother, who made cradleboards, beadwork, and hide work all her life. I would not be running my own creative business if it were not for her. She empowered and showed me that I am capable of creating and making beautiful things. I know 2020 has been a pretty rough year for everyone, especially for me, as I lost my grandmother at the beginning of the year. She would always encouraged me and I know I made her proud.We hope you enjoy our products as..."

After years of tossing the same wax melts into the cart (usually between dog treats and toothpaste), it all started to feel like just another chore. We missed the thrill. So, we created it.Waxetty brings back the joy of scent—fun, fresh, and anything but routine. What is Waxetty? We specialize in handcrafted wax melts made from our own premium blend of coconut, soy, and beeswax. Every scent is carefully curated using phthalate-free and paraben-free fragrances—because you deserve the good stuff. Our melts are long-lasting, easy to use, and don’t leave behind any soot or mess. Just beautiful, clean fragrance that makes you stop and go “ahhhh…” Why We Started After countless compliments from guests saying “your house smells so pretty,” we figured it was time to stop gatekeeping and start sharing. So we rolled up our sleeves (and probably had a wax spill or two) and got to work. Waxetty was our way of turning a simple habit into something we actually look forward to. More Than Just Wax Waxetty isn’t just a shopping cart—it’s a scent journey. We make it easy to fall in love with your all-time faves while still leaving room for surprise hits you never saw coming. Plus, we’ve got accessories like wax liners and warmer dishes to make melting simple, clean, and kind of addictive. Built by Family (and Supervised by Dogs) We’re a family-run business with a love for pets and playful scents. Our pups are always nearby—often “helping” by checking out the coconut waxes! Every product we make is pet-conscious, scent-sensitive, and tested in our own home before it ever reaches yours. When you support Waxetty, you’re supporting a real family (with real dogs) doing what we love.

    "brandStory": "When years of hustling in tech startups wreaked havoc on Sam's health, the Quebec City entrepreneur went looking for answers. His curiosity led him to a holistic health coach named Christophe Contant who prescribed him a daily regimen of movement, nature, and whole foods. It worked. One recipe in particular–a turbocharged twist on Bircher muesli that soaks overnight to be eaten in the morning–changed his life, restoring his energy levels and helping to heal his gut. They knew they had something big. Over the next two years, Sam, Chris, and an angel investor-turned-CEO named Charles Sansregret developed and perfected the product of their dreams: a magic muesli nutritious enough to help you go the distance, whether you're in the last stretch of an marathon or on your third all-nighter with a newborn. They called it HOLOS, derived from the Ancient Greek word holo ὅλος, meaning \"whole,” because of everything it is and aspires to be: the breakfast of champions and casual joggers, a real-food revolution in a reusable jar. As a kid growing up in Quebec City, a French-speaking city with cobblestone streets and old European charm, Sam always dreamed of starting his own company like his childhood idol Richard Branson. By 23, he’d actually done it. After dropping out of college and hustling in the music business–working for management companies and a live-streaming startup–he moved to Toronto and co-founded an app that let fans record themselves lip-syncing to songs as a way to create crowd-sourced music videos. The app, called JamCam, experienced some early success, partnering with PSY (of “Gangnam Style” fame) and launching Maroon 5’s single “Sugar.” But in the end, they struggled to gain traction and stay independent, ultimately losing out to their primary competitor, a Chinese app now known as TikTok. The stress of working in startups had taken its toll, and in early 2015, Sam returned to Quebec physically and emotionally depleted. Making matters worse, his on-the-go lifes..."

    "brandStory": "We’re Simps Modern Beverage, a company formed in 2014 by Dave Simpson and Gerry Jobe, two bartenders who decided to take a risk and trade in the nightlife in exchange for launching our own beverage brand. Since then, we’ve created the world’s first line of Vegan Caesar Mixes, launched Canada’s first Coffee Syrups brand, and opened a retail shop in Kelowna specializing in Non-Alcoholic beverages. We are a tip-to-tail beverage company. Whether you are looking for real cane sugar syrups for coffee, cocktails, Sodastream systems and mocktails, Bag-in-Box soda concentrates and mixes for your pop gun, beverage dispensing equipment, gas to power it all or perhaps something cutting edge like the world’s first and only water soluble adaptogens, that’s what we do! Our Name: “Simps” is short for Simpson, (as everyone knows Dave locally as such) and since we were making “SIMPle SYRUPS” it was a no-brainer. “Modern Beverage” speaks for itself, but in essence, we are always pushing the boundaries of what can be created, what can be innovated and challenging ourselves to attempt what has never been done before in the world of Beverage. That’s our pocket, that’s where we live. Our Symbol: The Trident was chosen as it is belongs to Poseidon, the defender of sea life (in regards to our fish/clam free Caesar Mix) as well as in honour of our country of Canada, whose original flag featured a three-pronged Maple Leaf trident. You’re going to google that now aren’t you? Our Syrups: Most Simple Syrup is just that. Simple. 50% Water + 50% Sugar. In comparison, Simps Syrups are produced at a 5-to-1 ratio, (5 parts Sugar to 1 Part Water) resulting in what we refer to in-house as a “Rich Cane Syrup” designed to carry flavour through dilution and heat. Our syrups are pasteurized, and preserved for 365 days so if you’re a slow-sipper, don’t worry, lots of time… We’re excited to see what you create with our syrups, so don’t forget to follow us on social media and tag us in your posts. Thank you f..."

In one popular toy show, it almost seemed the family was promoting this waste. A kid would open a treasure chest made of plastic, wrapped in plastic, with an egg carton of plastic sitting on top. Underneath the toy was more plastic, with 20 little parts wrapped in plastic.“This is insane!” Ryan thought.Ryan wasn’t a hardcore environmentalist by any stretch, but he cared about the world and his kids’ futures. He thought “there’s got to be something we can do! This plastic is just about convenience, but what if there’s a way to make sustainable packaging convenient?” Ryan called up his good friend Brad, a serial entrepreneur. Recently Brad told him about an extended-family member with a patent on laundry detergent that was supposed to be eco-friendly, but Brad didn’t really “get it.” “If it’s so eco-friendly, how the heck does it get my clothes clean?” Brad had grown up in an eco-conscious household, but couldn’t understand how an entire jug of laundry detergent fit in packaging the size of an iPhone. But when Ryan called him up he decided to actually TRY the product for himself instead of dismissing it. Brad, Ryan, and Ryan’s childhood friend Kevin each tried the laundry strips. All three of them concluded the same thing. This stuff actually works! That’s when we decided to become a team, but first we wanted to test our idea to see if anyone else loved the laundry strips as much as we did. Kevin set up a small webpage, Ryan wrote about his experience with the product on that page, and we put it out to market. We determined that 150 subscription orders in the first 30 days would be enough to take..."

Don't be fooled by the first sip. There’s no question about it, teas with \"natural\" or artifical flavorings hit big on that first sip. They immediately activate your taste buds and trick your brain into tasting something that isn’t there. But much like chewing watermelon gum – after a few chews you don’t feel so great.Those flavorings not only contain unlisted preservative and additives but they overpower with one note, and by the end of the cup dull your taste buds.Real ingredients develop in the cup and become more complex with each sip. Teas with real ingredients leave you feeling better with each cup. BROWSE REAL TEAS We're proud to be transparent, sustainable, and crafted with care at every step.

Over time, his passion for tea grew deeper as he discovered new flavors, growing regions, or steeping methods. And he was always sharing the best teas he found with friends.One of those friends was Harley, who like many of us was finding that coffee in the afternoon made him feel jittery and impacted his sleep. So David set Harley up with some incredible green teas that gave him sustained energy in the afternoons, without any of the jitters or side effects. A new tea lover was born, and so was Firebelly.

Alan – father, husband, friend, and mentor – whose energy was contagious and had a tendency towards larger than life ideas – was claimed by stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. It felt too cruel and it definitely felt too soon to lose someone deserving of so much more life.Deep loss inspired deeper inquiry, and as we waded through the realities of health and wellbeing, Nala grew from an idea into a necessity. We became incapable of ignoring an issue that rattled us deep within – a value we carry forth into what Nala stands for today.We are a mother-daughter founding duo, Radmila (Mila) and Ada. Leveraging our backgrounds in biotech engineering and technology, our goals are twofold:Change the way we, as a society, view health & self care by providing high quality products free-from negative side effects.End the meaningless suffering that comes from losing loved ones too soon. \"At Nala, we want you to care for yourself in a way that keeps you around for those closest to you for a long, long time to come\" - Ada Juristovski Jemc We Stand For Nala is a natural and organic body care brand that formulates high quality, efficacious products, while encouraging deep self care.

Today, our team of tea makers is proud to produce a wide range of hand-blended, top quality infusions for tea drinkers who value quality and sustainability - wherever they may be. Turns out, the best teas come in small batches. Our teas are made in small quantities with great care at our facility in midtown Toronto to ensure excellence in quality and freshness. Hand blending minimizes leaf damage and ensures that our makers can assess each batch and ingredient for quality, consistency, and freshness. Pluck Tea has earned GFSI / SQF Certification, a third-party audited, internationally recognized food safety standard - the highest certification possible for tea. Sustainability starts at home. Several of our favourite ingredients are grown and dried for us close to our production facility in Ontario including lavender and ginseng. This ensures that our teas are the freshest out there, while reducing our carbon footprint at the same time. We also source ingredients across Canada from farms in BC, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. Upcycling is delicious! Many of our ingredients are upcycled - which directly reduces food waste by repurposing fresh ingredients that could otherwise be diverted to compost. Pluck Tea is thrilled to be certified with the Upcycled Food Association. Examples include: Lemon and orange peels, saved and immediately dried for us by a local juice maker (who also happens to supply many of the restaurants we work with!) Cacao shells, reserved and roasted for us by a local bean-to-bar chocolatier Our zero waste glass jars are stackable, beautiful, and infinitely refillable. Let's talk tea. Tea is the original plant-based beverage. The plant itself (Camellia Sinensis) is indigenous to areas around the world that tend to be closer to the equator than Canada is.

    "brandStory": "Gather ‘round friends, and hear the tale of how Awake was hatched. From the founders We’re big believers in taking the road less traveled. You must be, if you’re planning to shake up a market where the biggest brands are literally 100 years old! And that’s what we decided to do.It started in 2010 while working for PepsiCo (great company), when we saw an opportunity to solve a problem. You see, it turns out that a lot of people are looking for a pick-me-up to help them get through the day. But many don’t want to drink more coffee and refuse to try energy drinks. Why? Because they don’t like the taste. Bad taste is no fun. We thought, why not make a chocolate to deliver that pick-me-up? After all, chocolate tastes great, and great taste is fun. And why shouldn’t chocolate do more for you than just taste great? So we created AWAKE, the first functional chocolate brand. We even pitched successfully on Dragon’s Den (the Canadian Shark Tank). We risked everything and left corporate life to chase our shared dream. Truthfully, the road has been long and difficult – COVID nearly sunk our business. That hurt, a lot. But passion and optimism are a powerful combination, so we persevered and now, with the help of our amazing team (the best in the business), our brand is thriving. We’re a decade in, and things are really starting to happen!Adam, Dan & Matt Guiding Beliefs Taste is our north star We’re the only functional snack delivering on physical and emotional needs – because we put taste first. Obsess over ingredients Good enough is not part of our vocabulary. We believe that less is more, so we stick to simple ingredients that are truly delicious. Do what’s right We believe you’re never wrong to do the right thing. So, we insist on giving back to our customers, FAIR pay for our suppliers, and making responsible choices throughout our supply chain. Have fun We believe that mood matters and that smiles are contagious… so we do our level best to make our customers smile everyda..."

I am the creator of Magic Oats. As a child, I grew up strictly on soy milk. My mom was severely allergic to dairy so this was all I knew. As time passed, I developed a hormonal imbalance so I decided to dig deeper on making some changes. One day, I came home from a specialty store with yet another plant-based milk I spent way too much money on only to check the label and discover fillers, oils, added sugar and stabilizers that made my gut and taste buds cringe - cue trash toss and follow it up with inspiration! Fuelling my obsession with healthy plant based food products I knew I could offer something better made with nutritious functional ingredients, that offered convenience, was easy to use and tasted undeniably more delicious. My mission is to share the most delicious better for you oat milk without compromise. ​ Founder: Lana"

The Doodle Dogs dream began in 2016, when a brother and sister duo had a plan to bring only the most CHIC | UNIQUE dog gear to Calgary.

Discover the story behind Ottawa's vegan soap and skincare boutique, where every product is handcrafted with passion and plant-based ingredients. Handcrafted vegan soap & skincare, since 2012 Hi, I’m Joulian, the founder of SAABOON. In 2012, I started making soap in my kitchen to help with my own skin sensitivities and to create something gentle, natural, and entirely plant-based. What began as a simple experiment grew into SAABOON—a Canadian skincare brand built on ethical values, quality ingredients, and handcrafted care.From the very beginning, I’ve crafted every product myself—from soap made using the traditional cold-process method to balms, oils, and other skincare essentials—always in small batches to ensure consistency and attention to detail. As a one-person business, I handle everything from making products to packing orders and photography. SAABOON is more than my work—it’s a reflection of care, purpose, and the belief that from small beginnings, something meaningful can grow. I use only the best natural oils and don't use synthetic chemicals or foaming agents, artificial fragrance oils, artificial colourings, or any preservatives. And I am 100% against animal testing! Why buy handmade soap vs. commercial soap? The answer is very simple, with handmade soap, you get exactly that – soap. Commercial soap are not always true forms of soap – they are often detergents. Detergents are petroleum-based products, filled with synthetic, harsh chemicals that will leave your skin feeling dry, itchy, and irritated. Most manufacturers also remove a large percentage of the glycerin from their soap because glycerin contains a high resale value. The glycerin is sold to other companies to make lotions and creams. Glycerin is the natural by-product in the soap-making process. It is a humectant (helps moisturize your skin). With my handmade soap, all the glycerin is retained. Whereas with commercial soap the ingredients consis..."

Each garment is produced with a commitment to best-in-class with great perceived value and excellent craftsmanship. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TOBOGGAN For most Canadians, tobogganing is a very popular winter sport. In modern times, a toboggan is used to carry one or more people down a hill or slope for recreation. However, this tradition dates back to aboriginal times when natives would use toboggans to transport their families and supplies across snowy tundra. Toboggans were often long and narrow to fit inside a snowshoe trail and were pulled by someone wearing a chest harness or by sled dogs. The word “toboggan” is said to have originated from the word for sled by the Ml’kmaq (Tobakun). With the arrival of the Europeans, who quickly adopted the use of the toboggan, recreational tobogganing was soon born! In 1881, the Montreal tobogganing club was founded. Since then, tobogganing as a recreational past time has evolved into some serious competitive olympic racing, such as bobsledding, luging and skeleton racing.

Founded by Natalie Dusome, a mom determined to navigate modern motherhood in style. Poppy & Peonies is a Métis female-founded, cruelty-free, Canadian accessory brand. Meet Our FounderHi I’m Nat, the founder and designer of Poppy & Peonies. Growing up in small-town Ontario, I was a little girl with a big dream: to become a fashion designer. I would drive my parents crazy-making clothes out of vintage curtains and harassing the local shop owners to carry my wire handbags as a teenager. This passion led me to design school, and after graduating, I honed my skills designing for global brands across Canada and the U.S.Then, something magical happened. My sweet daughter, Poppy, was born, and everything changed. My pre-baby accessories no longer fit my new life as a mom – I needed lots of pockets and organization. When my search for functional fashion came up empty-handed, I had a feeling I wasn’t alone. So, armed with an idea, lots of determination, and a six-month-old baby on my hip, Poppy & Peonies was born.We’ve come a long way in five years – from filling orders in my basement to appearing on Dragon’s Den, and now, expanding into new product categories and collaborating with some exciting brands. I’d be lying if I said it’s been nothing but smooth sailing, but thanks to our incredible community who inspires me every day, we have never felt more loved and supported!

Here’s how a renegade multivitamin drink mix was born, and why we strive to do better and be better every day. OUR STORY – THE LITTLE RENEGADE BRAND THAT CAN!Our little OG Ener-C team was born of a desire to do something different: we wanted to provide choice. Choice in the form of a delicious, natural multivitamin drink mix option, made with the most bioavailable, pure and sustainably sourced non-GMO vitamins and minerals and real fruit and vegetable-derived flavors and colors. We may still be a little fish in the grand scheme, but we have the energy to keep swimming upstream, powered by the belief we have something better to offer you in your quest to choose healthy and live healthy each day. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SOMETHING BETTER.Back in 2012, we found ourselves at a crossroads. Many of us had been part of a team distributing a different Vitamin C packet product in Canada for many years, until a large pharmaceutical company bought it, and changed the landscape for us all. We were faced with a choice: do we sit back, count our blessings and let the giants rule the earth… or do we band together and choose to create something different?At the daylight end of a dark night of our entrepreneurial souls, the answer came: SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SOMETHING BETTER. WHY, YOU ASK?Because we spent ten years collaborating with some very passionate and principled people and we didn’t want to say goodbye to the relationships we built with them and the knowledge we gained along the way. Because we knew in our bones that we could create something better. Because we knew we would eventually triumph over the “knock-off brand” association by choosing the purest, most bioavailable and planet-friendly ingredients and creating a incredible and delicious-tasting, convenient and truly healthy product. And finally, because our little team discovered we are made less o..."

Each candle we create is a little spark of inspiration, lovingly made by hand and designed to evoke a sense of calm and happiness. My journey began in beautiful Nelson, British Columbia, with stops in Manitoba and Ontario before life led me to Nassau, Bahamas. It was on this enchanting island that my love for candle-making was born. Inspired by the natural beauty around me, I became passionate about creating candles that were pure, environmentally friendly, and free from any harmful ingredients.Our commitment to pure, all-natural candles deepened with my mom's cancer diagnosis. This experience opened my eyes to the hidden dangers in everyday products, and it inspired our mission: to create pollutant-free, clean-burning candles that are safe for you and your home. Though we lost my mom in 2013, her spirit continues to guide us, inspiring everything we do.Today, our journey has brought us back to Collingwood, Ontario, where we pour each candle with meticulous care. We're proud to be local and Canadian, creating products that are local, sustainable, and crafted to perfection.

Founded in 2015 by Connor Curran and Dustin Paisley, Local Laundry began not in a fashion studio, but over a conversation about what community means, and how clothing could bring people together. The lightbulb moment came, quite literally, out of a broken laundry machine and a desire to make clothing that meant something. What if our shirts, hoodies, and hats were more than just garments? What if they were a celebration of where we’re from, a tribute to who we are, and a catalyst for giving back? From that moment, Local Laundry became more than a clothing company. We make clothing that builds community. Our mission is to build a stronger Canada, one garment at a time by supporting local manufacturing, giving back to causes that matter, and celebrating the people that make this country what it is. Proudly Canadian Made. It’s not the easy path, but it’s the right one. Every purchase supports Canadian workers, fair wages, ethical labour practices, and lower environmental impact. Read more"

    "brandStory": "In April 2016, Gabe Johnston founded Loon Kombucha in the cottage built by his grandfather in the 1960s, located on Otty Lake just south of Perth, Ontario. Knowing that almost all commercial kombucha has a harsh taste caused by hot-brewing demineralized city water, Gabe wanted this kombucha brewing company to be different, producing a pure and refreshing kombucha using high quality water and an innovative cold-brewing technique. Inspired by the purity of the Loons on the lake, who would sing as he brewed those first batches, he decided to name the kombucha brewing company after them: Loon Kombucha.With a desire to run an environmentally-friendly business, Loon was first sold exclusively in refillable bottles at local farmers’ markets in the Ottawa-Kingston area. The brand quickly developed a cult following. By June, so many grocery stores and cafes were requesting Loon Kombucha that Gabe had to move production to the Two Rivers Food Hub in Smiths Falls in order to increase capacity. Within a year, Loon outgrew the not-for-profit kitchen and made the move to Balderson, a small farming community north of Perth. This is when Loon Kombucha stopped using spring water and began brewing with Balderson's high quality, alkaline, and fully mineralized well water. Loon’s quality improved even more. The whole team knew they had accomplished something really special. Kombucha had never tasted this good.With kombucha brewing company growing and sales surging, Loon Kombucha broadened its reach and started distributing to Toronto, opened up refill stations as far as Kitchener, then expanded out as far as Collingwood and Parry Sound. Loon now ships nationally across Canada. Even though we’re expanding quickly, we still value our roots. We started as a local brand, introducing people to a kombucha inspired by the cottage country it was brewed in – pure, refreshing, and delicious. That’s what Loon will always be about.

Our Myni story Marie-Hélène David founded the company in 2020 with a goal of making safe, natural products accessible to families and the planet. The idea came to her the day she realized that her sink pipe had been corroded by the toxic fumes from her cleaning products.

The conclusion was clear: most cleaning products are harmful to the health of our families as well as our beautiful planet. All too often, traditional products contain carcinogenic ingredients. Also, in addition to making the consumer pay for water, transporting these liquids all over the planet has a very negative impact on CO2 emissions. What’s worse is the number of plastic bottles that are used once and then discarded. It was for this reason that Myni was born with the mission of reducing the environmental impact of the household and personal products we use, while offering a product safe for the whole family. We hope you have as much fun using our product lines as we had creating them! Marie-Helene David, Founder Since 2020 we’ve been working to create meaningful impact.

    "brandStory": "Our storyIn 2015, Patrice Plante had one thing in mind when he founded Monsieur Cocktail: to create a syrup that would bring the cocktail world to your home. Whether as a restaurant critic, as a chef or as a barman, he’s always been driven by a boundless passion for food and drinks, the quality and origin of ingredients, and the art of creating a delicious dishes and drinks with the simple aim of putting smiles on faces.His fascination with food and travel led him on an unsuspected adventure: the world of cocktails. The cocktail allows for an incredible rapport between individuals. Contrary to food, cocktails are not a necessity. They're an excuse to socialize and to spend time with loved ones.When Patrice got behind the bar, he was surprised to see that the ingredients didn’t match the quality and standard of what was done in the kitchen. He found odd fluorescent containers of bar mix, pasteurized juices and syrups made with fructose and artificial flavors. This was not how he wanted to convey his stories and enjoyment. Quickly tired of these mass-produced, soulless ingredients, he wanted to craft simple, natural and genuine replacements. After several years of passing on his passion and making his own homemade syrups to fill the gap, he made it his mission to make mixology accessible to everyone. In 2015, Patrice founded Monsieur Cocktail with the aim of creating the world's best cocktail syrup. A syrup made with real juice and natural sugar. A syrup with no artificial flavours or preservatives. A syrup that makes a great cocktail every time, and that is available everywhere. A syrup to make it simple. To add pleasure to your drinks, whether it’s sparkling water, iced tea, coffee, lemonade or something a little more complex. Today, you’ll find Monsieur Cocktail syrups and products everywhere: at neighbourhood BBQs, at parties, at romantic evenings with a special someones and at family camping trips.

She attended Kwantlen Polytechnic University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology and holds her Canadian securities designation (CSC). HOW DUCHESS COCKTAILS STARTED “In June of 2019, I was on a flight home from New York thinking that a cosmo would be great, and too bad they don’t serve those on flights. I thought, ‘someone should bottle cosmopolitans’.” Coupe Beverages Corporation was soon created and our first cocktail launched in December 2020. In 2022, we built out our own factory in East Vancouver to bring all production in-house — and Duchess Cocktails remains a self-funded, independent producer in Canada. Our cocktails offer a unique perspective; they’re not sweet, always made with real juice, and are stylishly packaged. BUT WE WEREN'T DONE INNOVATING In the fall of 2023, we launched DuchessDry to provide a real non-alcoholic experience, where taste and mouthfeel replicates that of a spirit-based cocktail, not just a juice and soda mocktail. ENJOY DUCHESS COCKTAILS Duchess Cocktails are ready-to-serve bottled cocktails, best enjoyed chilled, straight from the bottle, poured over ice, or in your favourite coupe."

That’s fine, but for us, the real test has always been how a coffee tastes in the cup, with no preconceived notions attached. That’s why the Global Coffee Awards caught our eye. It’s a blind competition that evaluates every coffee on a level playing field, judged purely on quality. No branding, no bias, just coffee. There aren’t many competitions like this in the world, which makes it all the more exciting. This was the first year of the event, with thousands of coffees entered from across Canada and the U.S. From that massive and talented field, we’re humbled and proud that our coffees stood out. Our Jose Joaquin Bolaños Geisha has been awarded a Gold Medal in the Filter/Washed Category at the Global Coffee Awards US & Canada, 2025! Sharing the news with Jose Joaquin was a special moment for us, marking the culmination of years of dedication, experimentation, and exceptional craftsmanship on his part. This coffee is available for a limited time, and can be found here. Our Candy Cloud Espresso, featuring Bekele Yutute Natural, also made a strong showing: • Silver Medal in Espresso – Single Origin/Experimental Processing • Silver Medal in Flat White / Alternative Milk • Finalist in Flat White / Dairy Milk We rounded out the competition with additional Finalist placements: • Espresso / Decaf – Lights Out Decaf • Filter – Single Origin / Traditional Processing – Lilac Dream, featuring coffee from the Danche (Gerba Dogo) site in Ethiopia.

    "brandStory": "Canada’s Home for Comfort Since 1992 Our Story It all started in 1989, in Vancouver, Canada. Inspiration struck when our founders, Howard and Jixin, came across a simple, yet exceptional product: a well-made, well-priced duvet. From there the mission was clear: to bring better sleep to all Canadians, with high-quality, affordable bedding. And the rest is history! In 1992, they opened their first two stores as ‘Quilts Etc’ in Clearbrook and Nanaimo, BC. Over three decades later, QE Home has evolved from a small family business into a Canadian household name. Though we’ve done some growing up, we’ve stayed true to our roots, putting family, comfort, and our communities first. Today, we have over 70 stores across the country, from Vancouver Island to the tip of Newfoundland. Whatever your style and however you sleep, our team of in-house designers and experts are dedicated to creating products you’ll love — using sustainable, high-quality materials that offer deeper, healthier sleep. No middlemen, no markups, just quality linens. Our Goal Your best days start with better sleep.

We started in 2011, mostly selling AeroPress and KeepCups to an emerging crowd of specialty coffee baristas and home coffee enthusiasts. As the market grew, we expanded our line of products considerably. We soon realised that it was difficult for Canadian cafes and roasters to bring in the high end specialty coffee brands that were so easy to get in larger countries. Buying smaller amounts and paying for freight and import made it not worthwhile for them. By bringing in large volume amounts of great quality coffee gear and taking care of the import and logistics, we made it possible to get the best coffee brands into Canadian hands. We're very picky about the brands we sell. We only sell the best quality product in every category - never selling knock-offs or imitations. We support those who innovate, not those who copy. We're now the biggest specialty coffee equipment distributor in Canada, selling to almost four thousand cafes, roasters, hotels, kitchen and lifestyle stores across the country and in America. We also distribute to some of the biggest and best names in specialty coffee around the world. We operate out of a thirty thousand square foot warehouse in Calgary, with team members in Calgary, Montreal and Toronto. We're a huge part of the growing specialty coffee scene in Canada - we help organise and sponsor barista competitions, AeroPress competitions, Brewers Cup and Cup Tasters, and are co-founders of the Prairie Coffee Collective. Nothing makes us more excited than the anticipation of a new cafe opening. We love the community of coffee in Canada - and wouldn't be where we are today without it.

Straying from the norm to follow his innate creativity and knack for entrepreneurship, Dean shifted from a career in agriculture to founding his own jewelry brand. This choice would lead him to travel the globe and adorn prominent figures in his designs.Travel is at the very heart of the Dean Davidson brand -- Balinese basket weaving, the bamboo forest of Kyoto, and Brazil’s otherworldly sand dunes have all served as inspiration, resulting in pieces that encapsulate the wonder gained from Dean's experiences. BEHIND THE ART Dean Davidson jewelry is designed in our Toronto studio. Every piece is hand-sketched in-house and sampled to perfect each design, producing iconic, signature features. Dean partnered with a family-owned workshop of artisans early on in the brand’s foundation. Located in Jaipur, India, a global hub for jewelry manufacturing, the multigenerational workshop specializes in fine jewelry and has created jewelry for the royal family of Jaipur. They cut every gemstone by hand according to Dean’s original designs, marrying time-honored tradition with forward-thinking aesthetics. “What sets us apart is our dedication to creating timeless, classic pieces that transcend trends and age.” - Dean Davidson, CEO + Creative D..."

We believe high-quality, beautiful jewelry should be accessible without the excessive markups.

Now you can say goodbye to care instructions—our pieces are designed to be worn everywhere. In the shower, at the gym, at the office, by the pool, and even while sleeping. Built to last through every moment, each piece is hypoallergenic, waterproof, sweatproof, and cosmetic-friendly. Our mission is simple: worry-free jewelry for every moment. We are a Canadian-owned business, with fulfillment centres in both Canada and the U.S. to help our customers avoid fees and duties. Made to Last, Made for You We’ve taken inspiration from the durability techniques of Swiss watchmakers to create jewelry that lasts. Using advanced PVD real-gold plating—the same process trusted by luxury brands like Chanel—we make highly resilient pieces that won’t fade or lose color. Pearlory’s PVD real-gold plating ensures longevity without compromising our planet’s health. Our jewelry is crafted from hypoallergenic, medical-grade stainless steel, so you can say goodbye to rust, tarnish, and irritation.

Inspired by Canadian flora and fauna, Megan was set on a path to start her own business after graduation. While working as a landscaper Megan balanced work and creativity. Slowly growing her tools and studio into a small workspace in the basement. Hard work and the great out doors have been two constants no matter where life takes her. While playing around in the studio, Megan made the first mountain ring. Inspired by the need to capture that feeling of home, and to carry it with you always. This changed the trajectory and everything started to fall into place. The first Mountain Maid came to be. Megan fulfilled her dream of having a full in house casting studio, by building it from the ground up. The studio became a safe haven and made room to expand the team. We call it our little slice of heaven, complete with everything one needs to create. Growing the team was our biggest adventure.

I have always been a bit of an entrepreneur, I’ve dabbled in a few small businesses and finally found my love in creating. I have had a successful crafting business since 2017. I am also an Educational Assistant with my local school board. When I am not working I can be found enjoying time with my family creating as many memories as possible. How it all startedAs most breastfeeding mothers my journey was a rollercoaster of emotions. With my son I had goals of exclusively pumping for a year. It was a lot of work and unfortunately, I ended up losing my supply when he was 3 months old. When I had my daughter, we were able to latch! I was determined to make it much longer. We powered through mastitis more than once, low supply, and other hurdles along the way. We made it to two years of breastfeeding! When it was time for her to wean it was such an emotional struggle for me to stop. I heard of breastmilk jewelry and new I wanted a piece made one day to commemorate this empowering and emotional chapter. I kept a bottle in my freezer for when I could afford to buy the perfect ring.Four years after my breastfeeding journey ended my husband decided that he was going to surprise me with a breastmilk ring. Unfortunately for him the plans fell through. Luckily, for me I have been a crafty person with a successful crafting business for the past 5 years and his thoughtfulness set the plans in motion for my researching how to make my perfect ring! After some extensive research I finished my ring, and it was more beautiful than I had imagined! I then got to work on making myself and my family a few beautiful memorial pieces. I decided to offer these special keepsakes to oth..."

Our lives had been forever altered and we dreamed of being able to once again live lives we could love. When our family was invited to Canada, our dreams came true. REBUILDING With the support of our new community of Antigonish and the people of Nova Scotia, we have rebuilt our chocolate company and are once again doing the work we love. Since Peace By Chocolate was founded at the beginning of 2016, we have been fortunate to share our passion for chocolate with new friends in our community of Antigonish, with people all across the province of Nova Scotia, and now around the world. PEACE BY CHOCOLATE TODAY Our desire for excellence is apparent in every piece of chocolate we produce. We passionately combine a blend of Syrian fillings and ingredients, including nuts, fruit, and spices, creating a little taste of heaven in every sweet.Inside each Peace By Chocolate product is uncompromising quality, with each chocolate a little work of art in and of itself, exuding sophistication, style and excellence. We encourage you to try our chocolate soon because, after all, One Peace Won't Hurt™.

As a family-owned and operated business, we pride ourselves in selecting premium ingredients and producing the finest chocolates and confections. We would like to thank all of our loyal customers for making Mordens’ of Winnipeg a family tradition for 60 years and counting. Timeline 1959 Mordens’ of Winnipeg opened its doors in 1959, when Blake and Shirley Morden founded Winnipeg’s first chocolate-making business. With a little training, a lot of hard work and endless determination, Blake and Shirley built Mordens’ into a beloved confectionary destination. In the early days, the entire Morden family worked side by side to build the business. Blake and Shirley were supported immensely by Blake’s parents, Fred Sr. and Lily. Blake and Shirley’s children, Cara, Shannon, and Fred, joined the family business as soon as they were old enough to fold a peanut brittle box. 1984 The Mordens’ passion for quality drove them to innovate. In 1984, Mordens’ Signature Russian Mints won top prize for Best Chocolate Piece at the World Fair in New Orleans. The Mordens’ were among the first candy manufacturers to produce chocolate covered jujubes and chocolate covered ginger, both of which are customer favourites to this day. 2007 Mordens’ of Winnipeg won the Excellence Award by the North American Packaging Association for the superior design, uniqueness and functionality of their cube box packaging. 2019 Mordens’ of Winnipeg celebrated their 60th anniversary and won Company of the Year for Industry Excellence by Food and Beverage Manitoba. Today Four generations later, the innovation and passion for quality continues. The Morden family now produces over 70 varieties of chocolates, confections and nuts."

Spurred on by the thought, Rami took a trip back to his familial home of Egypt where he found himself living in a cotton-farming community in the Nile Delta for six months.

    "brandStory": "Our story No washes. No distressing. Just raw denim from Japan, cut and sewn in Canada, built to last — and fade on your terms. vision We're a bit obsessed with denim—okay, maybe a lot obsessed. But that's because we are committed to sourcing and crafting only the most unique and exceptional denim fabrics from prestigious Japanese mills. These mills aren’t just fancy—they’re legendary. They blend old-school heritage with modern methods and practices. So much culture and history is poured into the fabric so that it can be appreciated by the denim purist. Our approach is straightforward: we keep denim raw, authentic, and free from unnecessary embellishments or treatments. That means no pre-distressing, no flashy embroidery, and no fancy washes. We skip the celebrity endorsements and expensive ad campaigns, investing instead in quality fabrics and precise construction to deliver the best denim at accessible prices. And here’s something we’re super proud of: every single pair of our jeans is cut, sewn, and finished right here in Canada. Always have been, always will be. That's the gist, but if you're curious to know more about our journey, our roots, and what makes us tick—keep reading. We are not a normal denim brand And we never will be. We develop crazy things and fabrics no one asked for — but everyone talks about. Cut, made, and sewn in Canada. Our history2008: LAUNCHWe launched to challenge the premium denim industry—no celebrities, no gimmicks, no washes. Just the world’s best Japanese selvedge, made in Canada, and priced honestly. Brandon Svarc, a third-generation garment maker from Montréal, set the tone: obsessive about fabric, allergic to nonsense, and ready to have fun. Our history2011: First StoreWe launched our first store, Tate + Yoko, right here in Montreal—where the garment industry shaped the city and our roots run deep. Our head office stands in the heart of what was once the needle trade’s core. While most of the industry faded, we stayed. Every prod..."
