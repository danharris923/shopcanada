    "aboutContent": "Find an A&WEn | FrCompany In 1956, the first A&W drive-in restaurant in Canada opened on Portage Avenue in Winnipeg. Serving a delicious combination of great-tasting burgers, onion rings and frosted mugs of famous A&W Root Beer™—all from the smiling faces of friendly car hops—A&W proved to be an instant hit. A&W Restaurants quickly multiplied across the nation, flourishing through the late '50s and '60s.Canada's original—and fastest growing—burger chain.In many communities, A&W was the first nationally branded restaurant in town. Because we were there first, our drive-ins served as \"the place to be\" in town. In fact, millions of Canadians today still carry vivid memories of special moments in their lives that took place at their local A&W drive-in. Whether they were kids in the back seat of the family sedan, or just hanging out with their best friends on a Friday night checking out the hot cars, Canadian baby boomers grew up with A&W. It's an enduring friendship that is the source of A&W's continued success across Canada.Since then, A&W has expanded to 1,050 restaurants coast-to-coast that are all Canadian owned and operated. At the heart of that growth is the fact that the simple things that made A&W so popular in our early days are the same today. We still serve A&W Root Beer™ in frosted mugs. Our Onion Rings are made fresh every day. And our Burger Family burgers are still made with fresh, quality ingredients, like our juicy grass-fed beef raised without the use of hormones and steroids.While our commitment to having the best-tasting food hasn't changed, our restaurants are dramatically different than they were in the drive-in days. As our customers' needs for convenience and faster service grew, our restaurants changed to meet those needs. The drive-ins of the '60s have been replaced by contemporary free-standing restaurants with drive-thru service and our A&W mobile app. We've also expanded into new, more convenient spaces. A&W Root Beer remains Canada's No. 1 brand of root beer and is available not just in our restaurants, but also in cans and bottles at your local grocery store.At A&W, we're on a journey to source simple, great-tasting ingredients, farmed with care. We're proud to have high standards when it comes to our food and you can taste it in everything we serve. It's all part of our commitment to serve you food you can feel good about.For us, great burgers come first. So it's only natural that we're the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve grass-fed beef raised without the use of hormones or steroids. We're also the first and only national burger restaurant in Canada to serve chicken raised without the use of antibiotics. Our eggs are farmed right here in Canada. We're also proud to serve Pret, always organic, 100% Arabica Coffee.With a rich history behind us, we look forward to an even more exciting future ahead. A&W is expanding all across Canada, and we're always looking for new team members. For restaurant or corporate employment opportunities, please visit our 'Work at A&W' page.

    "aboutContent": "Uniquely Canadian Our manifesto So nice to see you in our neck of the woods. Maybe you’re enjoying a sunny leisurely afternoon or touring with your favourite people, but only one thing matters now. You’re here.And that means you've just turned this moment into a lifelong memory. Our team is happiest when we’re at your favorite destinations, serving up hand-crafted pastries, poutines, refreshing beverages, and more. Because a moment shared with your loved ones is the perfect way to top off an already great day.So, whether you're strolling through an amusement park, hitting the slopes, or exploring a historic town, look to your left, look to your right—give everyone that “I’m-getting-BeaverTails®” smile. Because happy just got a little happier. Authentic Happy Memories Canadian Heritage Polite A Step in Time 1978 Where it all started Grant and Pam Hooker serve Grant’s grandmother’s handcrafted “BeaverTails” pastries to the public for the first time at the Killaloe Craft and Community Fair in Ontario’s Ottawa Valley—marking the start of a delicious Canadian tradition. 1980 Rolling into the Big Leagues Grant takes a big leap and builds the very first BeaverTails \"store\" — a cozy 15’ x 15’ wooden booth in the heart of Ottawa’s historic ByWard Market. Small but mighty, this little booth quickly becomes a local favourite, serving up warm, handcrafted pastries with a side of Canadian charm. Decades later, it’s still there — still tiny, still busy, and still making BeaverTails pastries like the day it opened. 1981 Hitting the Ice Grant and Pam roll out the very first BeaverTails operation on Ottawa’s iconic Rideau Canal Skateway. What starts as a single stand on the frozen canal quickly becomes a full-blown winter tradition. Within just three years, four pastry huts are serving skaters along the 7.8 km stretch — with up to 350 energetic crew members bundling up and braving the cold to spread warmth, smiles, and sweet treats all season long. 1988 A Sweet Leap into Montreal Grant and Pam take the plunge and open the very first BeaverTails location outside of Ottawa — right inside Montreal’s La Ronde amusement park. It’s a bold move and a brand-new adventure. But bringing a new treat to a new city isn’t always smooth sailing. That first summer? Let’s just say it wasn’t our busiest. Still, every great story has its humble beginnings — and this one was just warming up. 1989 New City, New Energy Pam, Grant, and their partner Andy Cullen bring fresh energy to La Ronde by recruiting a driven Montreal college student named Pino Di Ioia to help lead the charge. Tasked with building a strong crew of managers, Pino dives in — and with creative programs to introduce BeaverTails pastries to the Montreal crowd, things start to turn around. 1990s From Summer Job to Legacy As a university student, Pino Di Ioia managed the first BeaverTails stand outside Ottawa at La Ronde in Montréal. What began as a summer job quickly grew into a passion. The stand was converted into a franchise, and Pino stepped up as owner. Over the years, he rose from franchisee to master franchisee — and eventually, to CEO. His journey helped shape the brand and spread the magic of BeaverTails to fans around the world. 1990s A Sweet Turnaround In a stunning comeback, BeaverTails became the second-highest-grossing operation in La Ronde. What began as a quiet start quickly turned into a fan-favourite success story 2002 A Family Affair By the 2000s, BeaverTails entered a new chapter as Pino Di Ioia, his wife Tina Serrao, and twin brother Anthony Di Ioia took the lead. They relocated the headquarters to Montreal, streamlined operations and strengthened the brand's focus on quality and community. Their leadership transformed BeaverTails into the beloved, experience-driven community it is today. 2007 A New Chapter Begins The Di Ioia brothers and Tina step up as majority owners of BeaverTails Canada Inc., bringing fresh vision to the brand’s future. Grant and Pam remain close to the heart of the story, keeping a strong minority stake and exclusive rights in Canada’s National Capital Region — the place where it all began. 2009 Presidential Pit Stop Ahead of President Barack Obama’s first visit to Canada, the Hookers sent a warm invitation to swing by the original BeaverTails stand in Ottawa’s ByWard Market. To everyone’s surprise (and delight), the President saw the note — and asked his motorcade to make an unscheduled detour. The visit made headlines, and the photo-op became an iconic moment in BeaverTails history. You can see the invitation and photo Here. Today From Treat to Tradition With 50 iconic shops in bustling tourist towns and resort villages, plus over 150 mobile and express locations at amusement parks, zoos, fairs and festivals across North America, BeaverTails is always within reach. No matter where the adventure takes you, we're ready to serve up a delicious experience. The People Behind the Story Get to know the founders of BeaverTails — Grant and Pam Hooker — whose vision and dedication turned a small idea into a beloved Canadian icon. In 2023, they were honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Ottawa Board of Trade and Ottawa Business Journal. Read more \"BeaverTails is a Canadian right of passage—a must try if you can! It’s deep-fried goodness.\" Meaghan / Toronto Waterfront Did you know? We’ve got friends in high places; in 2009, on his first official visit to Canada, President Obama stopped by the Byward Market in Ottawa and enjoyed himself a delicious BeaverTails pastry. BeaverTails had a sweet moment in the spotlight on Saturday Night Live! Our iconic pastries were featured in a recent episode, showcasing their deliciousness to a national audience. Even comedy legends can't resist a classic Canadian treat! BeaverTails was featured in a 2015 episode of the classic comedy series South Park. We had nothing to do with the untimely death of Kenny, though, we swear! If you lined up, end-to-end, every BeaverTails pastry sold since our debut in 1978, the line of deliciousness would span across all of Canada. There would even be some extras to spare! Even celebs like to indulge their sweet tooth every now and again; we’ve had the pleasure of serving some tasty treats to Matt Damon, Ron MacLean and Ed Sheeran… just to name a few! Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield also enjoyed a classic pastry; however, his feet were firmly on the ground at the time. BeaverTails is for the lovers! Our delicious pastries have been part of countless marriage proposals, weddings, and first dates at our locations. Nothing says ‘love’ like sharing a sweet Canadian treat! We don’t want to overwhelm you, but there are over 120 possible topping combinations to try! Really hungry? The biggest BeaverTails pastry ever prepared was a whopping 6-foot treat! It was prepared in celebration of the brand’s 25th anniversary presence at Ottawa’s Winterlude festival in 2006. 62.5 tons of chocolate hazelnut spread goes into making BeaverTails each year! To put that in perspective, that’s the same weight as 90 moose, and those guys are heavy! We’ve got all the answers! “What is a BeaverTails?” was an answer (or question?) on the television quiz show Jeopardy, hosted by Canadian-born host Alex Trebek. Now that’s Canadian, eh? In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Bryan Adams declared that his most Canadian trait is knowing the difference between a BeaverTails and a Tim Hortons® Timbit. We couldn’t agree more! People love sharing their BeaverTails moments with the world! Over 76,500 of our amazing fans have shared their delicious #BeaverTails memories on Instagram.",

Sisters + Co-founders Growing up, Taran and Bunny, struggled with acne and sensitive skin. We tried countless products, wasted money, and nothing seemed to work. All we wanted was clear skin and the confidence that comes with it. Most existing solutions were complicated, harsh on our skin, and left us with scarring and feeling sad. Our breakthrough came when we discovered the power of all-natural ingredients in our routine, like those in our Meltdown oil. Focusing on anti-inflammatory and clean ingredients, this inspired us to create Blume, a line that truly understands and caters to sensitive, acne-prone skin with products that are both gentle and highly effective. We want everyone to enjoy clear skin without compromise. Most importantly, we want you to know that you are not alone in your skincare journey. We hope Blume is the last acne product you ever try, just as it was for us and 500,000+ Blume customers.",

    "aboutContent": "THE BOOSTER JUICE STORYBorn and raised in Waskatenau, Alberta, Dale Wishewan has always been driven to pursue and achieve success. Possessing a lifelong passion for sports and fitness, he attended Portland State University on a baseball scholarship. He was no slouch academically, either, earning his B.Sc. in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he returned to his home province to work in international technical sales for a company called Edmonton Exchanger. Dale enjoyed 8 years at Edmonton Exchanger growing their international division. While travelling throughout the United States, he noticed the popularity of juice and smoothie bars, and quickly realized there was an opportunity in the crowded Canadian fast-food market to provide a healthier alternative to consumers with an active lifestyle. Making his own protein concoctions for years, and with his interest in health and wellness, he made it a goal to bring fresh and healthy food to the Canadian market. The hard work began with his own home kitchen serving as the testing ground for one smoothie creation after another - including some of the most popular smoothies on our current menu! On November 13th, 1999, the very first Booster Juice location opened in Sherwood Park, Alberta.THE TIMING WAS PERFECT ... OR WAS IT?When the first store opened in Sherwood Park, it was a new concept to Canada. November was not the ideal time either going into the dead of a Canadian winter selling cold beverages. Co-workers, neighbours, and friends thought Dale was crazy to embark on something so foreign to Canadians when he had such a great career going at Edmonton Exchanger. If there is one trait Dale exemplifies, it is his determination. His grade 1 teacher, Mrs. Flaska, said she had never seen a student in all her years of teaching as determined as Dale. Nothing ever seems out of the realm of possibility. Not even selling smoothies in winter. As it turns out, people were ready for a healthy fast-food alternative, and there was nothing else like Booster Juice in the market. Things moved quickly after that. By the end of year one, 15 locations were open and in year two, another 35 more locations were added. This was such an achievement that it is still a Canadian Franchise Record for opening 50 stores in two years from inception. When others in the Food Service Industry have asked how he was able to open 50 stores in two years, Dale's reply is always the same. \"I didn't know in the first year whether 5 stores was typical, or 25, and everything came naturally from a project management side. The next thing you know we had 50 stores.\"Now, after 25 years, we are still blending up incredibly delicious smoothies, delivering convenient wraps, paninis, rolling up energizing Booster Balls, and freshly preparing nutritious shots and beverages.BLENDED WITH PURPOSEAs Canada’s original juice and smoothie bar, our mission is to create long-standing customer relationships by consistently delivering an incredibly delicious, convenient and nutritious product, perfectly suited for an active lifestyle.

    "aboutContent": "Proudly Serving Customers From Coast to Coast Dollarama was founded by third-generation retailer and Canadian entrepreneur, Larry Rossy. It all started with one store, in Matane, Quebec, in 1992, and quickly grew over the next two decades to become a household name and shopping destination for Canadians from coast to coast. Dollarama today is a recognized Canadian value retailer with international reach, with more than 2,700 locations and 41,000 people serving customers on three continents and in seven countries. The Corporation is led by Neil Rossy, fourth-generation retailer and member of Dollarama’s founding management team. Dollarama aims to provide customers with a consistent shopping experience and compelling value, offering a broad assortment of general merchandise, consumables and seasonal items. All stores are corporately-owned and operated, and are conveniently located in metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. Products are available in individual or multiple units at low, fixed price points. Our History Dollarama is proud of its rich history and its continued growth. Below are company milestones since our founding, representing key events of a story that is still being written today. 1910-1930 Where it all started In 1910, Salim Rossy opens his first S.Rossy Inc. store on Craig Street in Montreal, Quebec. Over the next two decades, Salim’s 10 children become involved in the business and its operations gradually expand. 1937 Transition to variety store Salim’s son, George Rossy, succeeds his father as president and transitions the model to a variety store similar in nature to the Woolworth chain. He leads the Company until his death in 1973. 1973 A new generation George’s son, Larry Rossy, assumes leadership of the company, which now counts 20 stores. Between 1973 and 1992, he more than doubles the S. Rossy Inc. store network to 44 locations. 1992-1994 Dollarama is born In April of 1992, in Matane, Quebec, Larry Rossy transforms one of his stores into the first Dollarama, based on a simple concept of offering all items for $1.00 or less. Based on this initial success, Larry Rossy and his founding management team go on to convert the other stores of the chain to this new concept, and begin to expand through new store openings as well. The first Dollarama store outside Quebec opens the same year in Grand Falls, New Brunswick. By 1994, Dollarama opens its first store in Ontario. 2001-2003 Growing presence in other Canadian provinces In 2001, Dollarama dramatically expands its presence in Ontario through the acquisition of 60 locations following a retail chain bankruptcy. In 2003, its first store in Manitoba opens. During the same period, Dollarama increases its distribution and warehousing capacity, with the opening of two warehousing facilities in Montreal, Quebec. 2004 Partnering for growth By 2004, Dollarama is growing rapidly with nearly 350 stores across six Canadian provinces. Private equity group Bain Capital invests in Dollarama through the purchase of a majority stake to support its continued growth. 2005-2006 Serving customers from coast to coast Dollarama continues its expansion into Western Canada, opening its first stores in Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2005. Store openings in British Columbia and Newfoundland follow shortly after in 2006. Dollarama is now present in all Canadian provinces, and its total store count exceeds 460. In 2006, Dollarama opens a distribution centre in Montreal, Quebec in close proximity to its warehousing facilities. 2007 500 stores and counting In 2007, Dollarama reaches a symbolic milestone with the opening of its 500th store in Ottawa, Ontario, with more plans for growth. That same year Dollarama moves in its new head office located in the Town of Mount Royal, Quebec, and opens an additional warehouse in Montreal, Quebec. 2009 Offering value at more than just $1.00 In 2009, Dollarama starts offering products at three new price points: $1.25, $1.50 and $2.00. This allows the company to exceed customers’ expectations of the quality and variety of products they can purchase at Dollarama. Following a successful initial public offering, Dollarama’s shares begin to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “DOL” on October 16, 2009. 2011-2012 700 stores and more compelling value In 2011, Bain Capital sells its remaining stake in Dollarama, now a well-established company, still committed to the disciplined execution of its growth strategy and to creating value for its shareholders. Dollarama celebrates the opening of its 700th store in Canada in 2012, and further expands its product offering with the addition of two new price points: $2.50 and $3.00. Additional price points continue to be well received by customers, now benefiting from even greater product selection and compelling value. 2013 Testing the Dollarama model in new markets In 2013, Dollarama enters into a licensing and services agreement with Dollar City, a value retailer established in El Salvador looking to expand its activities in Latin America. Dollarama starts sharing its business expertise with Dollar City and providing sourcing services, allowing it to begin testing the business model in new markets, work that continues to this day. 2015-2016 Accelerating growth and a natural succession In 2015, Dollarama celebrates the opening of its 1,000th store and confirms its long-term target to open up to 1,400 stores in Canada. New price points of $3.50 and $4.00 are also introduced in the key categories that have made Dollarama a unique value destination for decades now. In 2016, after contributing to nearly 25 years of growth and profitability, Neil Rossy is appointed president and chief executive officer while founder Larry Rossy becomes executive chairman. That same year, Dollarama opens a new 500,000 square foot warehouse in Montreal, Quebec, to accommodate growing capacity requirements as it continues to expand its store network. 2017-2018 Continued Canadian growth Customers continue to respond favourably to Dollarama’s simple business model and compelling product offering. In 2017, following a review of the market potential for Dollarama stores across Canada, management revises its long-term target from 1,400 to 1,700 stores in operation by 2027. Staying current with the times, Dollarama also starts accepting credit cards chain-wide. In 2018, after a lifetime in the retail industry, company founder Larry Rossy steps down as Executive Chairman and is named Chairman Emeritus. Stephen Gunn, Lead Director of the Board of Directors since 2009, is named Chairman of the Board. By the end of 2018, Dollarama has over 1,200 stores across Canada. 2019 Launch of second growth platform in Latin America, in complement to Canadian growth strategy Dollarama kicks off the year with the launch of its e-commerce site for the sale of select merchandise by the full case, available for delivery across Canada. In August of 2019, Dollarama acquires a 50.1% interest in Latin American value retailer Dollarcity following a six-year commercial partnership. This marks the launch of Dollarama’s second growth platform, in complement to its Canadian growth strategy. Dollarcity sets a long-term growth target of 600 stores by 2029, within its three existing countries of operation (Colombia, Guatemala and El Salvador), with the majority of store growth to be focused in Colombia. By the end of 2019, Dollarcity has over 200 stores. Dollarama completes the expansion of its distribution centre, located in the Town of Mount Royal, Quebec, thereby increasing its distribution capacity by approximately 50% in support of its long-term Canadian growth plans. 2021-2023 Reaching new milestones Continuing on its path of profitable growth with the aim of delivering unparalleled value to Canadians from coast to coast, in 2021, Dollarama sets a new long-term target of 2,000 stores in Canada by 2031. For its part, after successfully entering Peru in 2021, Dollarcity revises its long-term target in 2022 to 850 stores by 2029 in its now four countries of operation. By the end of 2022, Dollarcity had 440 stores. Also in 2022, Dollarama introduces price points up to $5.00 to maintain and enhance its broad product assortment and compelling value. In early 2023, Dollarama reaches a significant milestone, with the opening of its 1500th store in Canada. 2024-2025 More growth in Canada and LATAM; Acquisition in Australia In 2024, Dollarama increases its equity interest in Dollarcity to 60.1% and expands its partnership to include Mexico, to be Dollarcity’s next country of entry. At the same time, Dollarcity increases its long-term store target for Peru, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala to 1,050 stores by 2031, with future growth primarily focused on Peru and Colombia. With more than 1,600 stores across Canada, Dollarama also increases its long-term store target to 2,200 stores in Canada by 2034. That same year, it announces plans to develop a second logistics hub in the Calgary, Alberta region, to be operational by the end of 2027. In 2025, Dollarama extends its international reach and enters the Australian market through the acquisition of The Reject Shop, the country’s largest discount retailer with more than 390 stores. Dollarama sets a long-term store target in Australia of 700 stores by 2034. By mid-year, Dollarcity opens its first store in Mexico.

    "aboutContent": "The Goodfood origin storyOur journey from a Montreal apartment to being the #1 Canadian meal kit, creating a sustainably delicious food future.Meet the original Goodfoodies Our founders, Jonathan Ferrari and Neil Cuggy, are truly the original Goodfoodies. Before they started Goodfood in 2014, they each had an interest in our food supply chain that goes way back.Jonathan opened his first bank account at age six, with the goal of saving up to buy a tractor. While Neil developed a kitchen inventory management system when he was a kid, designed to recognize when something, like peanut butter, was half empty and automatically trigger a replacement order. Fast forward a few years, and the friends and former investment bankers found themselves starting what would become the #1 Canadian Meal Kit in a tiny Montreal apartment. “We always thought about ourselves as really differentiating by getting food on the table but making it exciting. Because Montrealers know how to do food. We were able to create really interesting recipes by just going to the market, finding a couple interesting things, putting them together in a dish and then serving it to friends and family at a dinner party,” reflected Neil.Nearly 10 years later, Goodfood has hundreds of thousands of customers across Canada, but we’re still choosing our recipes and ingredients just as carefully. “We won’t serve anything that we wouldn’t be proud to serve our families at Sunday dinner,” explained Jonathan. Good for business, good for everyone We’re doing this by sourcing our ingredients responsibly—a strategy that’s good for the business, our customers and the planet.“From a business perspective, we want to be involved in solving the world's biggest challenges because that’s where the greatest opportunities can be found. One of the biggest problems of our generation is to solve our climate crisis. It’s our generation’s responsibility to drive sustainable transformation across all industries, and Goodfood is leading the movement towards creating a sustainable food future we can all be proud of,” said Jonathan.“Neil and I live and breathe sourcing, manufacturing and delivering responsibly to take care of our planet, inside and outside of Goodfood,” he continued. “A couple years ago, we bought a beautiful piece of land in northern Quebec where we grow our own organic heirloom produce and eliminate 1,150 tons of carbon emissions per year. It’s our intention to leave it better than we found it for future generations and we’re striving to do the same with Goodfood.”Better supply chain = better food We prioritize providing local, seasonal ingredients in our meal kits because it’s what’s best for our customers, our communities and the environment. “When people really care about where their food comes from and how it's grown, it creates better food. It's so much more flavourful. It has a better impact on the environment because it's coming from somewhere that's closer to home,” Jonathan explained. “We’re also nurturing partnerships with farmers who are using the latest Earth-friendly technologies to do things like reduce water use and transportation times, and eliminate pesticides.” “By focusing on local partnerships, we’re enabling nearby economies, which will benefit both our customers and employees,” Neil added.“The old saying ‘you are what you eat’ really applies here. By contributing to the betterment of the planet, and providing fresh and nutritious home-cooked meals, Goodfood has a role to play in fueling active, healthy lifestyles and ultimately, helping Canadians live longer,” concluded Jonathan. We can’t wait to cook with you. Meet our head chef When you enter Jordana Rebner’s home you’ll immediately notice cookbooks —and lots of them—on her bookshelf and coffee table, in her kitchen, on her bedside table. They’re fitting decor for someone whose life’s passion is food. And they’re a source of inspiration for the 30+ weekly recipes she develops, alongside her team, as Goodfood’s head chef and vice president of culinary development.Jordana has been with Goodfood since its early days. A culinary school graduate, she joined the team after working at an upscale Montreal restaurant. She also has a Bachelor of Arts degree in industrial relations. Perhaps a surprising combination, but one Jordana finds works perfectly for her role. “I love being immersed in food all the time. Thinking about it, seeing it. It’s what I know best and what I get excited about. My role at Goodfood allows me to be creative, while activating the business side of my brain,” she said. “It’s a dream.”The joy of sustainable dining: More variety, less wasteEvery month Jordana and her talented recipe development and test kitchen teams put together a menu of exciting dishes designed to help Canadians discover the joy of home cooked meals. They start by considering which local produce is currently in season, then account for any upcoming holidays and what’s currently popular with Goodfoodies. “The beauty of Goodfood is that we’ll look through cookbooks and scour social media to find the most interesting and trending flavours, then plan your weekly meals for you. The team also draws inspiration from blogs, restaurants they’ve eaten at and family recipes,” explained Jordana. “Then we’ll provide you with fresh, seasonal ingredients that perhaps you have never imagined cooking with, in exactly the portions you need, so you can cut down on your food waste.” All of that saves you valuable time on meal prep and planning, but we know that perhaps the number one reason Canadians are cooking less is a lack of time in the evening —so Jordana and her team account for that, too. “We developed 30, 20 and 10 minute meal options because we know Canadians are busy and we want them to be able to discover the joy that comes from creating a delicious and nutritious home-made dish without the stress and time investment.” Learn more about what makes Goodfood the #1 Canadian meal kit here:Our Ingredients Responsibly sourced to maximize flavour, freshness and nutrition.Read moreSustainabilityLeading the way to a sustainable food future we can all be proud of.Learn moreGiving BackProudly feeding Canadian kids in partnership with Breakfast Club of Canada.Read more",

    "aboutContent": "ABOUT US Our Delicious, Smooth and Healthy Mission. Those are the things we’ve been obsessed with since Day One: making a healthier, smoother and more delicious shake is why Good Protein exists. We’ve spent years testing, tasting and sourcing the best ingredients to create plant-based shakes that taste exactly like your favourite sweet snacks and juices that are as satisfying as a freshly squeezed glass — all while offering your body everything it deserves. Super Good Superfoods Satisfying No more gritty textures, unpleasant aftertastes or bland flavours. Satisfy your body’s needs and your cravings with the same sip. High Quality We’re obsessed with finding the best ingredients in the world, because they’re often more nutritious and taste better. You’ll never find anything artificial in our products, only real, all-natural, plant-based ingredients that are GMO-, dairy-, gluten- and soy-free. More than Protein Our shakes and juices offer way more than just protein: they help curb cravings, improve your digestion, support your immune system, offer more energy and give you everything you need to keep your muscles healthy. This is Edward He founded Good Protein. But he was obsessed with health and nutrition long before that.Along the way he tried all the supplements and protein shakes out there, but they always left a bad taste in his mouth. Not only did they have a gritty texture and unappetizing taste, but they also focused on one aspect of what the body needed at the expense of others — like feeling bloated after a supposedly healthy shake. So, in 2019, Edward started scouring the world for the best suppliers and the highest-quality ingredients, with a single goal in mind: to create a shake that complements your daily diet – a nutritionally rich solution that provides essential nutrients for the body's well-being. Today, we’ve sold over 60 MILLION shakes in 12 different flavours, not to mention an immune system-supporting Green Superfood Juice, an energizing, antioxidant-rich Red Superfood Juice, a calming Golden Turmeric Latte, and a plant-based Collagen Booster.",

    "aboutContent": "At Mary Brown’s, it’s all about great taste. The kind of great taste that can only come from premium ingredients and careful, attentive preparation. Did You Know? Our Signature Chicken Is Canada Grade A, delivered whole and fresh Marinated, hand cut, hand breaded and cooked fresh Prepared in small batches, in each store Our Taters Are Made from whole, fresh potatoes grown by Canadian farmers Delivered in big brown bags to each store Cut, seasoned and crafted by hand daily Our Big Mary Chicken Sandwich Is Handmade in-store from a whole Canada Grade A chicken breast Made with no fillers Canada’s favourite! * According to the Daily Hive Even Our Coleslaw Is Handmade in each store from whole fresh carrots and cabbage Our Secret Mary Brown’s has developed its very own proprietary cookers. Rather than pressure fried, which is the industry standard, our cookers use heat to seal in juiciness and flavour and give our chicken its delicious natural golden colour. Mary Brown’s is real, wholesome, comfort food, made fresh daily. It’s always been that way – and always will be. We won’t settle for less. The Mary Brown’s Story It was 1969. While the world watched the first man walk on the moon, we celebrated the first Guest walking through our doors in St. John’s, Newfoundland & Labrador. Needless to say, it was a giant leap for chicken. Word quickly spread and stores opened across the province. It soon became the chicken of choice. Iconic even. It was time to, pardon the pun, spread our wings. By 1972, the secret of Mary Brown’s tantalizing chicken was out. Two stores opened in Ontario that year in Oshawa and Mississauga. From there, growth expanded west to Alberta, back east to the Maritimes, out to the Prairies and more recently, all the way to British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. Today there are almost 300 Mary Brown’s locations across Canada, and that number keeps climbing rapidly – coast-to-coast, in small towns and big cities – as more and more Canadians fall in love with our delicious food! Sit tight, we’ll be in your neighbourhood soon! 100% Canadian Mary Brown’s Chicken is 100% Canadian owned and operated. We source our chicken and potatoes locally from Canadian farmers. We support the Canadian communities our stores call home. Our way of doing things is decidedly Canadian too – be polite, keep your promises and put people first. No matter how many stores we open across this great country, we’ll stick by those values. It All Started with Mary Mary Brown was a real woman with an incredible recipe for fried chicken. After serving it to her family for years, her husband decided that the rest of the world deserved to eat as well as he did. He met with two wise businessmen from Newfoundland, who immediately fell in love with Mary’s chicken. They bought the recipe and started a chicken revolution In Canada. (Dramatic yes, but we take our chicken very seriously!) After a short time using the name Golden Skillet, the restaurant was named Mary Brown’s in honour of the woman behind the recipe. Decades later, Mary continues to inspire us! Want Fresh Deals? Download our App!",

After explaining that current makeup brands and collections simply don’t appeal to their no-nonsense attitude, they created NUDESTIX. NUDESTIX believes that your natural skin should thrive, and that you only need to cover here and there to get that perfectly, “go nude but better” look. OUR MISSION \"I believe the 'natural look' works well for every face. We're all born with our own unique look. When it comes to makeup, a little goes a long way. A dot here and a smudge there does the trick. Nudestix is all about embracing the beautiful in you.\" xx Ally\"I've always believed in a wash of color, so out with the crazy colors and in with the nudes. Out with the bag overflowing with compacts and brushes and in with simple makeup crayons for the face, eyes, lips and even cheeks. I think makeup should be easy, fast and—above all—fun! Nudestix is about effortless beauty - it's 'no-makeup' makeup you just draw and smudge on for perfection in an instant.\" xx Taylor OUR PROMISE The best part about our beauty brand is that it’s 100% easy, multi-tasking, fun and skin-loving ! At NUDESTIX, we believe a huge part of maintaining a truly natural makeup look is using good-for-your skin ingredients in shades for our global community of #babebosses. We know how much our #BabeBosses value a clean makeup routine; that’s why we make sure all of our products are paraben-free, gluten-free, cruelty-free with vegan options. Plus, our tin packaging is not only chic and made for the makeup lover on-the-go with a built-in mirror, but it’s also totally reusable — perfect for every eco-conscious #BabeBoss.Our promise is to deliver the best beauty products for #gonudebutbetter look by using clean, luxurious, award-winning formulas without sacrificing the quality, performance or look of your makeup look.

OUR HISTORY Princess Auto Wrecking (PAW) began life in 1933. The original owner sold the company to Harvey Tallman in 1942 for the money he received when he sold his iconic truck. Harvey began by selling auto parts to customers who came into his small outlet on Princess Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba. By the 1950's, PAW was buying parts in the United States, buying cars all over Western Canada, and Harvey had begun to travel in search of new products needed by farmers across Canada. Most of the products were War Surplus, and it was with those items that the first Princess Auto Catalogue was created. Harvey’s operation continued to grow and eventually relocated to a much larger location on the corner of Fort and York and a small manufacturing division called Shur-Lift was created. In time, Shur-Lift Industries would become a major supplier to PAW, which would change its name several times, first to Princess Auto and Machinery (PAM), and later, to Princess Auto Ltd (PAL). From Fort and York, the company eventually relocated to Panet Road where our Home Office continues to operate to this day. In 1977, Princess Auto became a retailer, with the first store opening in Edmonton, Alberta. Less than a year later, Harvey Tallman decided to retire, leaving the company to his two sons, Larry and Bob. Princess Auto grew quickly after that, with stores opening across Western Canada. Larry announced his retirement and sale of his portion of the company to Bob in the spring of 1989. Princess Auto’s family legacy continues today, with Bob’s sons Matthew and Marc Tallman taking ownership of the business in 2018. They are working with our Team Members to ensure that we are constantly innovating while staying true to our roots: providing hard-working Canadians with the most unique assortment of tools and equipment, unrivalled customer service and exceptional value, for nearly 100 years.",

Our free in-store pick-up service is safe and convenient. Before adding an item to your cart, check the availability of the product in your desired store location. If available, add the product to your cart and then select the Store Pick Up option at checkout. You’ll be then asked to confirm the store where you’d like to pick up your item. If your store of choice does not appear on the list, it is because the product is unavailable at that location. The closest stores carrying the product will appear instead. An email will be sent to you confirming your order. Once it is ready, you’ll receive an email letting you know it’s time to pick up your order from your selected store. To give you even more freedom of choice, you also have the option to split your order. It means you may choose to ship some items to your home and pick up other items you’ve selected in store. Make sure to bring a government issued photo ID and order confirmation email to the store indicated on your Ready For Pick Up email. What is curbside pick up and how to place an order? Our free in-store pick-up service is a safe and convenient option to pick up your order without having to leave your car. Order online as usual, then select Store Pick Up at checkout.

Simply proceed to the selected location and call the store to let them know you’re here for your curbside pick up. An available sales associate will then bring your order to your car.

Unfortunately, requested or scheduled pick-up times are not available as turnaround to prepare your order will vary from store to store. Make sure to bring a government issued photo ID and order confirmation email. What is the difference between in-store pick up and curbside pick up? An in-store pick up order is an order purchased online and then collected by you inside the store of your choosing. Our curbside pick up option offers the convenience of never leaving your vehicle to receive your goods. With curbside pick up orders, a sales associate will meet you at the designated pick up area with your order in hand instead of you collecting it inside the store.

What happens if I did not receive a pick up confirmation email? Your “Ready for Pick Up” email will provide you with full pick up instructions including the selected store address.

    "aboutContent": "About Us EARTH EVERY DAY At Rocky, we feel our best in nature, that’s why for 25 years we’ve been students of this glorious Earth— formulating everyday essentials that nurture your face, body, and hair, all crafted with care right here in the Canadian Rockies. PROUDLY MADE IN CANADA SINCE 2000 Rooted in their connection to the outdoors, Rocky co-owners Cam and Karina pioneered natural beauty products from their small mountain town in the Canadian Rockies. They grew Rocky from a local gem into what it is today—more than two decades strong, fueled by their passion and commitment to natural ingredients. INTENTIONAL FORMULAS We use only Earth’s ingredients—carefully selected and obsessively formulated by our science team and in-house herbalist. Mindfully crafted in our workshop, we incorporate only what is essential and good. We prioritize Canadian ingredients. Since quality and availability can vary, we also work with trusted suppliers worldwide, ensuring that every ingredient meets our rigorous standards of quality. Once an ingredient passes our standards, we begin the formulation phase. This process often requires more than 50 prototypes to perfect each formula and can sometimes take several years. Learn more about our natural standards CONSCIOUS PRODUCTION Once our formulas are perfected, our manufacturing team (located right in the same building as our lab) begins production. Although we’ve grown, we still do things slowly. It still takes six weeks to make our cold-process bar soap, and we still hand-press our bath bombs—we just have a lot more hands now. Next, we manage the distribution of our products. The fact that we do it all right here means we maintain meticulous oversight over all aspects from sourcing to packaging ensuring the highest level of care and consistency throughout the entire process. “Having our lab and workshop in the same building allows our team to collaborate closely. If something isn’t working, we’re only 21 stairs away from finding a solution” - Karina Birch, CEO Rocky THOUGHTFUL CHOICES From production to packaging, we see ourselves as both students and stewards of the Earth—always learning, evolving, and making choices that benefit both our customers and the planet. We know it’s not perfect, but we’re committed to the ongoing discovery of the most responsible options, including closing the gap between product and packaging lifecycles. We’ve long prioritized waste reduction, skipping secondary packaging whenever possible, encouraging refill sizes through our Rocky Refills program, and offering label-free bar soaps. Now, we’re entering a new phase of growth: a thoughtful packaging redesign years in the making, launching summer 2025. Learn more about our new stores MAKING AN IMPACT TOGETHER Because of you, we've been able to give back to both our community and nature. We partner with organizations that create positive change for people and the planet, working together to leave the Earth a better place. We've been able to give back to nature through our community bar program and holiday gift sets, supporting Canadian not-for-profits and charities like the Nature Conservancy of Canada. We’ve also given back to our community through our annual Women’s Soap Run in Canmore, supporting organizations like Fast and Female and Spirit North, which empower women, girls, and indigenous youth to participate in sports. Learn more about how we give back OUR STORES Like nature, we’re growing. With 13 stores in Western Canada, we’re expanding nationwide—with our two newest locations opening in Ontario this year: Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket and Sherway Gardens in Etobicoke. Our new stores are designed to bring nature indoors. Crafted from natural materials, they guide customers through immersive sensorial experiences anchored by our signature sink—unique to each location.

    "aboutContent": "About Us The Beginning of Stanfield's Charles E. Stanfield had no idea when he immigrated to Canada in 1855 that he would found the firm that would become recognized as Canada's leading manufacturer of men's underwear. In the beginning, Charles, along with his brother-in-law, Samuel E. Dawson, founded the Tryon Woolen Mills in Tryon, P.E.I. in 1856. Ten years later he sold his interests to Samuel and moved to Nova Scotia. In 1870 he founded the Truro Woolen Mills, which at that time was located on Brunswick Street. It was believed to be the first factory of its kind in Canada. Tryon Woolen Mills, Tryon, Prince Edward Island - 1856 During this period, Charles was constantly looking to expand the operation. He purchased other mills around eastern Canada, including the Carding Mill in St. Croix, NS (1872) which he renamed the Ste. Croix Wool Factory. After a few years, Charles and family sold the Ste. Croix mill to Alxander Dunbar and returned to Truro to focus there. This marked the official renaming to the Stanfield Mill. As the company grew, the factory was relocated from Brunswick Street to its current location on the south bank of the Salmon River (Logan Street) in 1882. These important events would be crucial to setting the company up for success in the coming decades and century. Stanfield’s annual stag picnic. August 17, 1935 Building A Brand Charles was a creative genius. He maintained a workshop in a barn behind his house where he spent the majority of his time creating new equipment and products. He developed and manufactured the first cardigan jackets and stockinettes in Canada. He introduced Canadians to heavy rib underwear and the famous “Drop Seat.” He also manufactured sweater cloth and knitting yarn. In 1896, Charles sold his business to his two sons, John and Frank Stanfield who had their own vision for the company’s future. They believed the way to build a reputation was to build a stable product line in one specific field, despite their father’s advisement otherwise. They chose to specialize in knitted merchandise and renamed the company the Truro Knitting Mills Limited, accordingly. It was a good decision. We Are Unshrinkable Together, John and Frank developed the famous “Shrink-proof Process” which catapulted the little Truro underwear company to fame. The Klondike Gold Rush of 1897 provided them with their first big break where some 100,000 people, spurred by rumors of gold, made their way north to the harsh terrain of the Yukon. The Stanfield’s “Unshrinkable” Underwear was pivotal to the would-be-prospectors and miners who could find no substitute for the warm, heavy, woolly underwear. Stanfield’s Limited went on to incorporate in 1906. During World War 1, they manufactured wool blankets, knitting yarn and cloth that provided a major impetus for the expansion of the Firm. After the war, John Stanfield was appointed to the Senate. The Building Block The early 1920’s marked a turning point when a peroxide process was developed to bleach underwear, opposed to the sulphur process that left a distinct odour behind. Stanfield’s also began carbonizing wool, a process that produced a much softer fabric. The late twenties saw the first line of cotton combinations and the use of synthetic rayon was used to produce ladies’ undergarments. Stanfield’s entered the undershirt and brief field in the late thirties, two-piece winter underwear in the forties, and Thermal underwear in the fifties. The latter two gradually took over the winter underwear market, providing the building blocks for the company’s product growth over the many years to follow. Stanfield’s is also responsible for popularizing the T-shirt in Canada as well as men’s Polo Pyjamas. Stanfield’s factory production An Industry Leader Today, Stanfield’s is a leader in its field, taking pride in its products and ability to adapt and stay ahead of consumer market needs and wants. Whether it be introducing new fabrics, blends or styles, we’ve always stood by our basic policy of “the best product at reasonable prices,” and will continue to do so as we move forward. Fashion forward, technologically advanced, and when possible the majority of its products will be made in Canada. Stanfield’s is a specialist in underwear products and has rightfully earned its reputation as ‘the Underwear Company’.",

    "aboutContent": "A Family Affair Since 1840 “Fashion has been our passion since 1840! A uniquely different and inspiring fashion retailer, we are known for offering the most sought-after styles and looks from the world's design capitals and providing a level of service available nowhere else. For five generations, we have been renowned for our devotion to customer care. Today, our more than dozen stores are a dazzling tribute to architecture, art, attentive service, and to a shopping experience second to none.” - Richard and Peter Simons 1840 | Our origins The birth of a legendary family business Our story began in 1812 when Peter Simons arrived from Scotland and settled on a small farm near Quebec City to raise his family of five. In 1840 his son Archibald moved into the city to open a small shop, where he sold dry goods and various imported wares. To make sure his business received the latest in goods from Europe, he made over 70 Atlantic crossings by sailing ship. In those early days, Archibald Simons was already putting an emphasis on quality merchandise and attentive service, setting the stage for the future success of La Maison Simons. 1870 | Old Quebec A golden history In 1870, John Simons moved his shop to 20 côte de la Fabrique, where it remains to this day, along with the Simons head office. The building's charming 19th century façade and interior arches are just a few of the architectural elements that bear witness to the store's rich past. The store was enlarged in 2005 and renovated in 2007. Modern Times The Sixties | Creating exclusive brands Donald Simons was part of that generation of young entrepreneurs who possessed remarkable intuition and a true spirit of innovation. In the booming postwar years, he quickly saw the importance of serving the needs of an increasingly modern society. Under his influence, La Maison Simons created exciting new fashion brands in Quebec. The sixties saw the birth of Twik, in sync with the day's new young woman of 16 to 25. This exclusive brand broke with traditional codes and stood out with daring pieces by young designers driving a revolution in fashion. Women 30 to 40 were also more and more on the move, and La Contemporaine moved right along with them, offering fashion in tune with their lifestyles. Le 31 pour homme, an original formula playing off the French expression for the sartorial man, was the name of the new shopping destination for men of all ages. La Lingère also became an innovation leader with its enticing and fashion-forward selection of home designs. 1961 | Place Ste-Foy Modern majesty Our Place Ste-Foy store has always been a flagship for La Maison Simons. It was the first to open its doors in a shopping mall—a daring move at the time—and it was the first to give prominent play to men's fashions and to home linens. The store was completely revamped in 2007, doubling in size to offer shoppers a totally new and exciting architectural concept. Its minimalist forms are a dazzle of pure white and light, making it a wonder of avant-garde design. Today the store embodies the Simons ideal of functional harmony and ordered beauty. 1981 | Galeries de la Capitale Remembering times past Designed to serve a suburban clientele outside the centre of Quebec City, our original Galeries de la Capitale store took its inspiration from antiquity. Its roman-style pediment, ionic columns, and laurel wreaths fit in seamlessly with the latest trends. The extraordinary work of art found in the cupola further embellished this exceptional space where history and modernity met. Expanding out 1999 | Downtown Montreal Urban reflections Montreal is a city full of drive and energy, and our St. Catherine street store is its perfect reflection, with its circular, multilevel design centred around an imposing mobile sculpture by Guido Molinari. A profusion of details evokes movement and fills the space with the urban bustle and excitement so characteristic of Quebec's leading city. 1999 | Carrefour de l'Estrie The beauty of nature Our Sherbrooke store celebrates the beauty of nature at its purest. The copper leaves that adorn the façade in a flourish of organic curves oxidize over time, naturally taking on new hues as they weather. Inside, gracious, rounded forms bid a warm welcome to shoppers and guide them through the store. 2001 | Promenades St-Bruno A symbiosis of design What a gorgeous sight it is when the morning sun reflects off the façade of our Promenades St-Bruno store! As they capture the first glints of light, the metallic walls turn from slate grey to a bright coppery orange hue. This morning spectacle is a testament to the way nature interacts with the materials we used to create this store. The imposing industrial façade contrasts markedly with the natural, fluid curves of the columns sculpted in the shape of callas and the other rounded decorative touches found inside. The overall impression is one of dazzling distinction. 2002 | CF Carrefour Laval Covering all the angles The Laval Simons store is an example of modern architecture that draws on simple forms like squares and rectangles to form a visually complex whole. The interior lighting emphasizes the simplicity of the shapes, while the angles and cubic outcroppings suggest structured spatial design. The delicate balance between the geometry of the architecture and the bustle of the shopping floor creates a truly exceptional ambiance. Tying Together Tradition and the Future 2008 | Quebec city's 400th anniversary A historic gift To commemorate the founding of Quebec City, the Simons family wanted to give their fellow citizens a gift that would show their love for the city that welcomed their ancestors: the Fontaine de Tourny. First chanced upon in a Paris antique store, it now stands in front of Quebec's National Assembly, an exquisite focal point for the parliamentary grounds. This treasured urban antique, which won gold at the Paris world's fair of 1855, was cast to celebrate Bordeaux's new water supply system. After a complete restoration, it was inaugurated in July 2007 to kick off Quebec's 400th anniversary celebrations. 2010 | Entering the digital age Simons is branching out and offering our unique selection of fashion items to customers all over Canada via the web to spur new growth. In store or online, the same passion transmitted from generation to generation drives the entire Simons team to offer Canadians trendsetting fashions, a totally inspiring environment, and extraordinary customer service. A Luminous Presence 2012 | West Edmonton Mall A western fashion foray The first Simons store ever outside Quebec opened in October 2012 at the biggest shopping mall in North America. The work Aurora by international artist Philip Beesley is an interactive installation that reveals the exciting new potential of architecture that interacts with humans by oscillating in response to the movement of shoppers. 2013 | Galeries d'Anjou Modern elegance The architecture of our Galeries d'Anjou store evokes the spare elegance of patterns on fine fabrics or leather. The simple outside contours of the building glow in a constellation of lights at dusk. 2015 | Promenades Gatineau Revisiting our origins The Promenades Gatineau store draws its architectural inspiration from the Scottish heritage of the Simons family. The iconic prince of Wales fabric on the outside and the fashion art atmospheres created by the interlaced patterns and textures on the inside make this location a fashion circuit must. The store was also home to the first-ever café Ève, which is now closed. The café featured a gourmet menu that paid tribute to Grandma Simons. 2015 | Park Royal South Cross-cultural encounters For our West Coast debut, we felt it was only natural for Simons to evoke the culture of local communities and pay tribute to the Indigenous peoples of this land! Architectural details at our Vancouver store incorporate themes cherished by the Squamish Nation. An eagle carved on granite by Jody Broomfield at the store entrance elicits the link between the real world and the spiritual world, while a traditional weaving pattern recalls the arrowhead blankets typical of the Coast Salish peoples. 2016 | Square One Tying together tradition and the future White concrete, 3D triangles, and green accent notes evoking leaves blowing in the wind characterize the first Simons store to open in Ontario. Its signature art and architecture-including Raincity Robot, a sculpture by artist Brendan Lee Satish Tang-and its stairways that seemingly float in space are a reflection of the company's core mission of tying together tradition and the future! 2016 | CF Centre Rideau Cultivating creativity With its ideal location in the very heart of Ottawa, our second Ontario store marks a meeting between modernity and retail's rich history in Canada. Completely made of glass, the store's top floor looks like a crystal box set atop the existing heritage building, which has been magnificently restored to preserve its architectural value. Inside, fashion fuses with art: Torrential Red, a marvellous sculpture by Canadian artist Shayne Dark, hangs in the store's centre. In...",

Founded in 2009, we've remained fully vertical, crafting every piece by hand in our Montreal atelier. This approach isn't just rare - it's now officially recognized by the Canadian National Mark, a distinction that verifies our jewelry is made entirely in Canada and meets the highest standards of ethical craftsmanship. The Montreal, Canada Atelier At the core of Ecksand's operations is our state-of-the-art workshop in Montreal, Canada. Here, our skilled artisans bring each design to life entirely by hand, ensuring that every detail meets our exacting standards. This vertical integration, from design conception to final polish, allows us to maintain complete quality assurance at every stage of production. Designed with productivity and purpose in mind, our atelier fosters a safe and pleasant working environment. We prioritize environmental responsibility by filtering used water before it returns to the Earth, and capturing all volatile polishing compounds with specially engineered vacuum systems. By controlling the entire manufacturing process, we guarantee that each piece not only reflects our commitment to sustainability but also embodies the unique artistry that sets Ecksand apart. learn more about the ecksand atelier Certified Canadian Craftsmanship Ecksand has been awarded the Canadian National Mark—an official designation granted by the Commissioner of Competition.

For decades, high-end jewelry has been synonymous with towering markups. Layer upon layer of added costs, from intermediaries to inflated luxury pricing. By sourcing directly and crafting entirely in-house, Ecksand dismantles this outdated model, delivering exceptional craftsmanship and French-Canadian heritage without the artificial price tags.

Sofia Zakia pieces always have a story to tell, or a symbolic meaning, making them feel powerful to wear. Founded in 2016, each piece is an unconventional, tender exploration with symbolism, borrowing from the worlds of art, history, and science in a harmonious juxtaposition of luxury and storytelling. Sofia works to create ceremonial jewelry that is alive with meaning, handcrafted to be passed down over lifetimes. Our customer care is available Monday through Friday from 9:00am - 5:00pm.To reach us during these hours, please send us a message at info@sofiazakia.com OUR FOUNDER Meet Sofia Sofia Ajram is the Canadian Arts and Fashion Award-winning Designer of Sofia Zakia jewelry. She is also the author of the Bram Stoker Award-winning novella Coup de Grâce. Sofia lives in Montreal with her cat Isa.Growing up, she cultivated a strong interest in speculative cinema and literature and applied those interests to the several facets of visual arts. In 2011 she began metalsmithing classes with a focus in wax carving. In 2016, Sofia launched Sofia Zakia, a channel to combine her fascination with the art of goldsmithing and jewelry’s long and wonderful history of wearable objects with meaning.Sofia strives to join the quiet intimacy and elegance of jewelry into communion with the magic of poetry: heirloom objects that act as mirrors to love, pulling threads of inspiration from myth, literature, art, and memory, both new and old; universal and personal. Eternal love letters Inked in precious gems & gold Exquisite craftsmanship Eternal love letters Inked in precious gems & gold Exquisite craftsmanship Thoughtful Design & Sustainability ETHOS & MATERIALSOur relationship to the design process begins with materials themselves, wrought from the enchanting poetry of our home planet.Our precious stones are ethically sourced from Sri Lanka, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Tanzania, and the United States. As often as we can, we work with miner-to-market gemstone collaborators, artisan gem cutters, and gem dealers dedicated to transparent supply chains and education on responsible sourcing practices. Most often, we work with Capricorn Gems, Columbia Gem House, Moyo Gems, Caleb Quashen, Misfit Diamonds, and Sorbet Sapphire. We are proud to work with natural recycled diamonds and conflict-free gold and silver to ensure our supply chains includes well-researched, transparent relationships which exclude destructive environmental practices and improve miner work safety and improve trade opportunities for miners.

We have an enduring commitment to environmental principles, from artisanal studio methods to non-toxic, low energy requirements for local production. We work with Canadian suppliers as well as artisanal and small-scale mining and cutting operations to find materials that support social and economic impacts at the source. WHO WE ARESofia Zakia is proudly LGBTQI+ run and led. We believe in building a diverse team and operate an inclusive workspace in our production studio.SUSTAINABILITYEach piece is completely designed, carved, engraved, set, polished, finished, and thoughtfully wrapped in our Montreal jewelry studio.

Jewellery Care There’s an old adage to remember: “First thing off, last thing on.” In an ideal world, your jewellery should be the first thing you remove before getting ready for bed at night, and the last thing you put on after getting ready in the morning! Perfumes, lotions, sunscreens, hair products and cleansers can all wreak havoc on metals and gemstones alike, causing colour changes, dullness, and lasting damage!GENERAL CAREWhen not wearing your jewellery, store cleaned pieces in a cloth pouch (for gold or costume pieces), or in small plastic baggies (for silver and gold vermeil). Store chains individually to avoid tangling, and remember to do up the clasp!It’s important to always remove jewellery before exercise.While human skin is only mildly acidic at rest, sweat is a different story, and that acidity can cause certain metals to change colour- sometimes permanently! It’s best to be careful while weight training as well: you wouldn’t be the first person to damage or bend a favourite ring when handling a barbell!Remember to remove your jewellery before swimming, hot-tubbing or going into a sauna.Chemicals like chlorine will bind to certain metals and can cause permanent damage to your pieces! While it is often possible to scrub the black-brown patina off of a ring or necklace that was worn in the pool, the influence of those chemicals is insidious, causing a slew of damage not visible to the naked eye.Similarly, watch out for salt water and intense heat! While both can trouble your metals, the real victim here tends to be gemstones: some gems will change colour or lose luster when exposed to intense heat or humidity, and porous or organic gems like opal and pearl will suffer from exposure to salt! It’s a good idea to remove all jewellery before bed.Chains especially can suffer when slept in: they twist and pull as we shift in our sleep, causing the links to stretch unevenly. While this might not be obvious as first, the strength of a chain lies in its ability to evenly distribute weight- that means a stretched chain is at an increased risk of breaking, and we doubt you’d want that to happen to something you love so dearly you’d sleep in it!Unguarded earring posts can cause discomfort for side-sleepers, leading to potential tenderness or restless sleep. To ensure your comfort, be sure to either wear earrings designed for comfortable sleeping, or soften the posts of your favourite studs with a pair soft silicon backings.Lastly, there is strength in numbers! If you have a stacking ring it is best to pair it with a friend or two, they will stay in shape longer.CARING FOR GOLD & PLATINUMGold and platinum are the rockstars of the jewellery world, and for good reason: from their rich, unchanging colour to the ease of care...",

Proudly Canadian and women-owned, this is jewellery made to feel like you. Canadian & Women Owned Founded in the prairies and grown across Canada, we’re proudly women-owned and purpose-driven. We’re here to reimagine what jewellery can mean—when it’s made for self-expression, not expectations. Style That Shows Up We believe in jewellery that does both: bold design and everyday wearability. From standout shapes to thoughtful details, our pieces are made with high-quality materials and backed by a 2-year warranty. Purpose in every piece This is jewellery that stands for something. Every purchase fuels our 1% for women give-back, supporting self-identified women through our community partnerships and charitable impact. How it started Founded in 2007 by Rachel Mielke in the Canadian prairies, Hillberg & Berk began with a single goal: to change how women experience jewellery.

Over $400K contributed in donations and jewellery to mission aligned causes. Surpassed 7000 women gifted through our national partnership with the Dress for Success Canada Foundation.

    "aboutContent": "About UsOur mission today is the same as it was in 1972: to design shoes that help young people try new things, explore fresh experiences, grow into themselves, and step confidently through every chapter of life. We’ve been around through every season, era, and cultural shift. Our very first shoe, the Frida clog, was a bold reimagining of traditional Swedish and Japanese designs - our first shot at trying something different. It was unique, distinctly modern, and in tune with the free-thinking, rebellious, and curious spirit of the 70’s. That spark? It’s still in everything we do. Decade after decade, we’ve designed with the same joie de vivre. Trying has always defined us. Nerves and excitement are our north star, we find joy in the journey. We take inspiration from the world and the people in it to create wearable styles that inspire self-expression, bring fun into the everyday, and outlive the trends to become a beloved core memory in your closet. Our Founder StoryThe grandson of a shoe cobbler, son of a shoe merchant - our founder Aldo Bensadoun was, in many ways, destined to follow in footsteps. Yet it was his unique upbringing and his deep curiosity about the world that inspired him to forge his own path in the creation of ALDO - a brand built on passion, purpose, and innovation. Designed In MontrealIn 1972, Aldo founded his company in Montreal - a city in progress, evolving into an international centre of culture and commerce. It was a global crossroads where diverse worldviews, styles, and traditions converged to shape new, collective visions. Today, ALDO designs with the same spirit of curiosity and connection. Our designers work together to create with purpose and passion - constantly exchanging stories and ideas, and finding inspiration together. First MilestonesALDO began as a modest concession stand in a local department store - a small footprint with big appeal.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story our origin storyAs a young Métis entrepreneur, Sean McCormick began Manitobah Mukluks with the vision of creating a successful company while benefiting his community. Today we continue that vision on a larger scale, as a global brand making a positive impact in Indigenous communities across North America. Sean McCormick spent much of his childhood in northern Manitoba and started selling leather and fur while still in high school. In 1990, he established a trading post where Indigenous artisans traded handmade mukluks and moccasins for tanned leather, skins and furs. During this time, Sean saw an even greater opportunity to connect members of his community to the growing demand for authentic Indigenous footwear. In 1996, after completing the Manitoba Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneurship Training Program, Sean created the business plan and framework that would become Manitobah. In 2008, Manitobah began global operations and today it is one of Canada’s fastest-growing companies, with employees and customers worldwide. Despite the rapid success and growth of the brand, Manitobah remains connected to its roots and continues to provide authentic, Indigenous-designed products that return value to Indigenous communities. Manitobah became a certified B Corporation™ in 2023, a designation that demonstrates a business meets high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices and input materials. Manitobah – Founded 1997 – Winnipeg, Manitoba 10,000 Years of designThe original winter boot is a mukluk and the original shoe is a moccasin. Designed 10,000 years ago to keep Indigenous people warm, the unique blend of form, function, and material allows them to thrive in the world’s coldest conditions. All of our designs honour and continue the history of innovation, craftsmanship, and beauty. Can I wear moccasins and mukluks if I am not Indigenous? Absolutely! We make our moccasins and mukluks for everyone. By purchasing from us, you are participating in cultural appreciation, not cultural appropriation. When you purchase from Manitobah, you are directly supporting Indigenous people and celebrating Indigenous culture in an authentic, meaningful way that helping us in our vision to create positive impact in Indigenous communities. Mukluks are soft boots traditionally made of hide, created by Canada's First Peoples for warmth and maneuverability in natural environments. The word 'mukluk' originated from the Yupik word maklak, meaning bearded seal – a key animal source for Aboriginal clothing in the north.The Inuit and Yupik were the primary Aboriginal groups in the Arctic who wore mukluks (known as kamiks among the Inuit). In the subarctic, various styles of mukluks and moccasins, a closely-related, soft shoe, were worn by each Aboriginal group in Canada. When Western explorers arrived in the seventeenth century, they too adopted the traditional footwear for survival in the Canadian wilderness.Originally, mukluks were made from sealskin, moose hide or caribou. The boots rose to the ankle or mid-calf, and in winter were insulated with the fur of beavers, squirrels, bears or other animals.The soft, flexible design of both the mukluk and moccasin was well suited for travel in fragile birchbark canoes in summer and skin kayaks and snowshoes in winter. However, the manufacture of each pair represented a great investment of time and energy for both hunter and craftsperson. Under ordinary conditions, a pair of mukluks or moccasins might last a couple of months, but when groups travelled and conditions were bad, four to five pairs of moose hide moccasins could be required each day.With the arrival of European fur traders, design and crafting techniques began to change. Aboriginal women, especially those in contact with trading posts, played an important role in this process, learning new sewing techniques and incorporating new materials and styles into their handwork. One reason for their acceptance of foreign innovation was sheer practicality. With ready-made fabrics, a craftswoman no longer had to scrape the skin, soak and tan it, stretch the hide and/or even sew the garment. Traders also took part in accelerating the change, encouraging the adoption of European fashions in the hopes that Aboriginal hunters would spend more of their time in the pursuit of fox, beaver and muskrat for the fur trade rather than hunting caribou or moose for clothing.With this new influence, mukluk and moccasin designs flourished. Pom-poms, tassels and delicate beading patterns on the top of the footbed began to appear and over time the motifs became custom. Today one can easily trace a decorated mukluk or moccasin back to its particular geographic home. Just as Indigenous people have always done, we strive to use natural materials. We continue to develop our products using materials that support Indigenous teachings of sustainability. New Arrivals Best Sellers Waterproof Cozy Indoor View All Collections follow @manitobah",

Andrea was knee-deep in glitter by the time she could walk and has been creating ever since. Growing up together as young sisters we would dream of someday owning and operating our very own retail store.We’ve always been big-dreamers, cautious risk-takers, and huge believers in love. Yeah, you could call us hopeless romantics. Working for ourselves was always the obvious choice, and who wouldn’t want to work with their bestie?!You see, we are a little bit of retail nerds with an obsession for authentic customer service. Our favourite thing to do when visiting a new place is to check out it’s trendy independent shops. Gathering inspiration and learning how other retail businesses differentiate always excites us. It must be in our blood or something cause together we have always wanted to provide a special shopping experience. Until in 2014 when Sash + Bustle came to be we didn’t exactly know what that meant.Sash + Bustle has some how married (pun intended) all of our skill sets andpassions as individuals. One of our favourite work-perks is that S+B allows us to be a small part of a bride’s wedding day, which we couldn’t be more honoured for. Supporting other women has always been a driving force for us. It gives us the warm and fuzzies when someone lights up in a gown, when they feel like the best version of themselves and they just FEEL great.

Our Founder A lover of jewelry and all its intricacies, Mel has always been a proponent of reimagining a classic and telling a story through exquisitely designed pieces. Melanie’s journey to jewelry started as a passion and a curiosity and after attending countless metalsmithing classes, she was guided toward what would soon become her career, creating modern yet nostalgic jewelry. Travel is a key element in sparking inspiration and new ideas into Melanie’s designs. Exploration allows her to refresh and rejuvenate, creating space to put her process in motion and connect to new people and places that will inevitably inform her designs. It wasn’t until after years of traveling and living abroad that she settled down in Vancouver with her husband and two children, realizing then, that designing jewelry was her passion.

    "aboutContent": "About Made You Look Made You Look jewellery is more than a shop—it’s a curated gallery and creative studio where artistry, community, and custom craftsmanship come together. Our Commitment Celebrated as one of Toronto’s best jewelry stores by our loyal patrons, we remain deeply engaged in nurturing our local creative community. Our Story Nestled in Toronto’s vibrant Parkdale neighborhood, Made You Look has become a celebrated destination for those who value originality and local talent. We represent over 100 Canadian jewelry designers, offering anything from distinctive engagement and wedding rings to personalized pieces that tell your story. 2025 CJA Award Sarah Dougall and Made You Look Jewellery are the proud recipients ofThe Canadian Jewellery Association Impact Award, formally known as the Erol Paylan Lifetime Achievement Award in 2025. This is a prestigious honour presented to individuals who have made significant and lasting contributions to the Canadian jewellery industry during their career. Recipients are recognized for excellence in leadership, innovation, education, ethical practices, and a commitment to elevating the professional community. This award reflects a career defined by passion, integrity, and a deep dedication to advancing the jewellery trade in Canada. Our Founder's Story Sarah Dougall is a Toronto jewellery entrepreneur, designer, and community builder best known as the founder and owner of Made You Look Jewellery, a long-standing artisan studio-gallery in Parkdale. Collapsible content Read Sarah's Full Story Sarah Dougall was born in New Zealand and moved to Canada as an infant. After high school, she discovered the Jewellery Arts program at George Brown College in Toronto and immediately knew she had found her calling in jewellery design. She completed the program in 1999, acquiring both technical skills and an awareness of how difficult it was for graduates to launch professional jewellery careers.In 2001, Sarah opened Made You Look Jewellery with a bold vision: to create a collaborative environment where independent jewellers could both design and sell their work directly to the public. The doors opened with 12 jewellers each renting a bench, and has evolved into a studio-gallery representing over 100 local designers, including 20 self-employed jewellers who create their pieces onsite.The studio became a Toronto landmark, offering one-of-a-kind, handmade pieces and emphasizing craftsmanship and local artistry. Dougall’s approach was to provide a “stepping stone” between college and professional life, eliminating barriers to entry for emerging artists.Dougall describes her mission as creating a “high-vibration workspace” built on kindness, authenticity, and collaboration. She encourages new jewellers to enter the craft with both creative courage and business awareness. Her philosophy centers on the belief that handmade jewellery “feels better on the body” and carries the maker’s intention and energy.Under Dougall’s leadership, Made You Look has become one of Canada's most respected artisan hubs — part boutique, part open studio — blending retail and creative community engagement. The business has been thriving for close to 25 years, a milestone Dougall regards as an amazing achievement. There was \"no map for this\" she says - just blind faith and a strong belief in what we can accomplish through collaboration rather than competition. Sarah Dougall served as President of the Metal Arts Guild of Canada (MAGC) from 2006 to 2010, a pivotal period in the organization’s growth and community engagement.During her tenure, she led initiatives that strengthened Canada’s national metal arts network, supporting both emerging and established jewellers, metalsmiths, and educators. Her presidency emphasized education, collaboration, and professional development within the craft community. She oversaw the coordination of lectures, national exhibitions, and public events across Canada, fostering creative exchange and elevating the profile of Canadian metal artistry.Sarah Dougall has also been a long-standing community leader in the Parkdale Village neighbourhood, serving for many years on the Parkdale Village Business Improvement Association (BIA) in Toronto, including as Chair and Vice Chair.In her role with the Parkdale BIA, Sarah has been instrumental in promoting local economic development, supporting small businesses, and revitalizing Queen Street West as a diverse and creative corridor. She has been actively involved since the early 2010s, helping to grow Parkdale’s profile as one of Toronto’s most vibrant art and retail communities.Her advocacy and volunteerism have contributed significantly to Parkdale’s ongoing revitalization, ensuring the neighbourhood remains inclusive, artist-friendly, and economically sustainable. Through both the BIA and her personal business efforts, Sarah has strengthened Parkdale’s reputation as a model of grassroots leadership and arts-driven urban renewal.Under her leadership, the BIA focused on encouraging collaboration among business owners and fostering connection between community, commerce, and creativity — values that reflect the same spirit embodied by her studio, Made You Look Jewellery.What kickstarted this brave ambition? The birth of her Son, Simon Dougall, who was only 4 months old when Made You Look's door first opened.

    "aboutContent": "About us Hi! I’m Sara Escobar, the hands and heart behind each piece you’ll find here. Originally from Colombia and now based in Canada, I’m a professional social worker with a deep passion for human connection, creativity, and storytelling. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with diverse communities across Colombia, listening to powerful stories and learning from every experience. During one of those journeys, I discovered a traditional bead-weaving technique that immediately resonated with me. What started as a meditative and personal escape quickly evolved into a meaningful form of self-expression—and a way to uplift other women through handmade accessories full of intention. Each piece I create is a reflection of inner exploration, cultural heritage, and a deep love for slow, purposeful craftsmanship. My work blends organic and geometric designs, and every accessory is made by hand in my cozy studio in Keswick, Ontario, using refined weaving techniques with thread and wire. You can find my creations at art and craft shows in Toronto, California, and Colombia, as well as at select consignment stores, including: Savile Studio and Market Amazing Graze | Mississauga Hometown Heart Store Ltd Every design can be customized in a wide range of colors and is made to be lightweight, waterproof, and vibrant—unique pieces for unique people. Thank you for being here and for supporting handmade art that tells a story. 💛",

    "aboutContent": "About Us Over 60 Years of History From our humble origins as breakfast experts – to today’s menu with dozens of modern dishes for any time of the day, Ricky’s is a place where everyone feels at home. Ricky’s opened its doors in Vancouver in 1962 as Ricky’s Pancake House, famous for buttermilk pancakes, value breakfast specials, and the very best service. Ricky’s expanded in the 1980s to include full lunch and dinner. As well, in 2014, Ricky’s acquired ABC Country Restaurants, a chain that had delivered great country fare for over 40 years. This merge brought together two great brands, both with a rich history of delivering exceptional food and service to Canadian families. In 2017, the Ricky’s brand further expanded with the launch of Ricky’s Café, a new contemporary café concept with an express burger and sandwich bar and gourmet home meal takeout service. All while still serving the famous breakfasts and high quality lunch and dinner items Ricky’s is known for. With ongoing expansion, including new locations opening in Alberta and BC, Ricky’s has 85+ locations across Canada to serve you. There's Always Something New at Ricky's As the number of our locations continues to grow, so does our menu. Ricky’s breakfast menu has been enhanced to include favourites like Eggs Benedict, and our now famous Brekkie-Bowls. Lunch has everything you want with mouthwatering sandwiches and fresh never frozen ½lb Canadian Certified Angus Beef Burgers. Dinner has all your comfort foods and classics, with new foodie choices like authentic Global Bowls, succulent wine-braised Beef Short Ribs and hand-and-beer battered Fish & Chips. Good For You Good For The Planet Ricky’s is committed to uncompromising food quality and freshly prepared recipes using high quality, sustainable ingredients. We proudly serve Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee and breakfast meats raised in Western Canada without antibiotics and hormones. Or try one of our fresh never frozen ½lb certified Alberta Angus Beef burgers. And don’t forget to top them off with Windset tomatoes or fresh avocado. Maybe you’re in the mood for our hand-battered Southern Style chicken tenders or hand-and-beer battered Ocean Wise cod fillets. We even have gourmet sandwiches made to order! No matter what you pick, you can’t go wrong when you pair them with our hot and crispy, fresh cut Kennebec fries to complete your dining experience. Welcome to our Kitchen One thing has remained the same over all of these years. At Ricky’s, we go out of our way to “WOW” our guests with amazing service and exceptional value, continuing to make Ricky’s a neighbourhood family favourite. Ricky’s works hard to prepare delicious dishes for all parts of the day…breakfast, lunch and dinner. Want breakfast for dinner? Ricky’s listens to what our guests want, making breakfast available all day. So whether it’s our hand-battered Chicken & Waffles, “Not So Traditional” Beef Dip, or Amazing Ginger Bowl, we’re ready to serve you. Come In, We’ll Make You One.",

    "aboutContent": "Our Story WHY BREAKFAST? We believe that breakfast should be bolstered by artistry and passion. Our chef-driven concept is led with soul, where the emphasis lies on the people that produce, create, serve and consume our fresh, iconic cuisine. On your plate? Familiar classics balanced with unreplicatable fare you simply won’t find anywhere else. With the philosophy of “learn, teach and inspire,” our welcoming spaces each tell their own unique stories. Together, we provide an exceptional, ever-evolving experience – leaving you soul-full. Our Chef Who Is Mauro? Our spirited founder and classically trained Chef, Mauro Martina, has cultivated a culture that prioritizes connection and genuine food integrity. Mauro spent his childhood in Italy, exposed to fresh, rich ingredients of local markets on a daily basis. For Mauro, these experiences were centered on incredible food, but more importantly, connecting with those who cultivated their bounties with love. With his culinary foundation built in Europe, Mauro moved to Canada in 1992. It was here that he embarked on his career as an executive chef at just 21. Mauro quickly climbed the ranks in both Toronto and Calgary, and in 2009, he fed his entrepreneurial spirit by forging a farm-to-table experience for the meal that fuels us all – breakfast. Today, Mauro remains at the helm of OEB and its growth – bringing his unmistakable energy to farmers fields’, bustling OEB spaces and vibrant kitchens. Our Vision WHAT’S NEXT? OEB was established in 2009; in Calgary – a Canadian city with big potential and small-town values. We pride ourselves on a vision that supports our people – from farming partners, to chefs, managers, employees, and finally, our incredible guests. We aim to invest in, educate and broaden horizons with every connection we make. The people at OEB possess a deep love of food, giving staff the confidence to excite and welcome guests. The OEB menu is purposeful, filled with items that simply can’t be made at home, balanced by lighter fare and vegan options. There is heart and integrity behind the quick, well-executed service at OEB, and employees take the initiative to get to know each other and guests personally. Understanding that breakfast is the best place for honest, good connection. With distinct locations and plans to grow, OEB pushes the culinary boundaries of breakfast food to bring you the best in quality and craftsmanship – and we’re sticking to it. Our Values what do we stand for? Outstanding People – From our talented suppliers, to our staff and loyal customers. We’re a company led with heart and soul, prioritizing personality, connection and values above all else. You see it through our friendly and familiar service, and we feel it in every interaction. Embracing Evolution – From new dishes to new locations. We have confidence in our growth and change, because we make every move with intention. We push culinary boundaries without losing sight of our humble foundation. Bold Food Integrity – From farm-to-table in our practice and mentality. We serve unreplicated fare balanced with familiar, well-made classics. We pride ourselves on favouring seasonal, fresh ingredients at all costs, nurtured with love from our partners.",

    "aboutContent": "It’s always been about Wonder and Warmth.Our story started well before we served Monogram’s first coffee. We (Ben, Justin and Jeremy) met working together as three overly-excited baristas eagerly starting out on our coffee journey. What made those times so special was that everything was about discovery, exploration and learning about coffee. It seemed like everyday brought new tastes, new techniques, and new friends. Despite coming from three different backgrounds (music, health sciences and development), we came together because of our shared love of exploring the world of coffee.However, we quickly realized that specialty coffee at the time exuded an air of elitism and exclusiveness that we didn’t feel comfortable with. We knew firsthand that exploring the amazing world of specialty coffee was better shared, and not part of some exclusive club. So we started Monogram to create a place where we could passionately pursue some of the world’s best coffee, and use it to bring people together. Ever since, we’ve made it our mission to make it easy for all people to discover amazing coffee. Since our humble beginnings serving coffee from our hand-built coffee cart, celebrating flavour has always been a part of our DNA. The way our coffee tastes is inspired by the many people and experiences around the world that play a role. Firstly, our long-term coffee producing relationships. Mariana Iturralde leads a team at Finca Takesi that raises and nurtures beautiful coffee in some of the world’s harshest growing conditions. Jamison Savage from Finca Deborah and the Lamastus family from Elida estate in Panama are constantly at the forefront of processing technique. And Daterra blends innovative technology with a passion for the rainforest to make one of the world’s most environmentally sustainable coffee farms.Secondly is the Monogram team. We are photographers, foodies, runners, and musicians. There are science geeks, content creators, gamers and everything in between. Throw in a couple competitive speed-skaters and film buffs and you’ve got the Monogram Team. But what brought us all together was a passion for helping our diverse communities explore coffee.Now we source, roast and share our coffee with people in our flagship cafes in Canada, and in homes and through wholesale partnerships throughout the world. We’re grateful to have represented Canada at the World Barista Championships as 9 x Canadian Champs. And as you find your flavour and discover the the world of coffee with every brew, we hope your experience is inviting, super exciting and makes you feel like part of the story.Consider this a warm invitation to explore the wonders of coffee with us.Ben, Justin and Jeremy Blog posts Oct 22, 2025 Ben Put lands 3rd place at the 2025 World Barista Championship!

As we became mothers and began raising families, it became apparent to us how strongly we value immersing our children in their culture. Raising Kanyen'kéha speaking children at home we realized how much work needs to be done in our modern 21st century society to create space for Indigenous youth to have a positive upbringing, that has accurate and positive reflections of themselves in their daily lives. We began our brand to meet this challenge. At Sapling & Flint, our designs are \"conversation pieces that share the story of Turtle Island\". We are proud to keep our operation local.

Starting as a coffee cart in 1993, we opened our first café in Stratford, Ontario in 1996. Since then, we have grown to 16 distinct locations and can be found on the shelves of grocery stores across the country.Find A Café What distinguishes Balzac's, aside from unrivalled roasts and formidable female leadership, is that every café is specifically designed to embody the cultural nuances and historical significance of the location it's in. In doing so, each café has carved out a unique personality as a central gathering place for locals. People come to a Balzac’s café to converse and debate, to fall in love and create. And the fact that all Balzac's cafés have garnered quite the loyal following proves that providing a place for people to drink excellent coffee in the authentic French tradition has an appeal that can only be described as everlasting.

    "aboutContent": "Our Process We design and manufacture right here in Ontario Local, hands-on, and creatively driven. We manage every part of the process, from concept and development, to shuttling rolls of fabric and boxes of garments through their series of steps in our local supply chain. This is how it happens... It Begins in House Location: OkayOk Toronto StudioOur studio is a design lab for both our garments and surface designs. Upstairs from the shop we do it all, from the pattern drafting to establishing the final finishing techniques. Graphics & Surface Design Location: OkayOk Toronto StudioAll our prints are developed and applied in-house. Our surface designs are created with heat transfer vinyl and other mediums. Allover prints are designed right on the garment: laid out by hand and applied with precision and rigorous attention to quality. Fabric Sourcing Location: Brampton + Toronto AreaOur cotton jersey and fleece textiles are made by a fabric mill in Brampton, ON. We also seek out interesting overstock fabrics from local mills and factories. Designing with what’s already available is part of our creative process. Cutting & Sewing Location: Mississauga, ON + the OkayOk StudioWe are cutting and sewing small releases of garments right in the Okayok studio, as well as partnering with skilled local manufacturers for larger scale projects. Keeping everything local and small batch allows us to stay flexible and maintain quality at every stage. Garment Dyeing Location: North York, ONWe choose new colour stories every season to dye our garments and socks. Having control over this important aspect of our products has made Okayok who we are today. Experimenting with colour will always be a part of our creative direction and development. Sock Production Location: Brampton, ONOur socks are made on non-computerized, antique sock knitting machines. These machines give our socks their low tech, vintage quality, the same they would have been 50 years ago. We love their imperfect charm and the satisfying rhythm of the process. Most of our socks are now made with manufacturing yarns we purchased from a Toronto sweater factory that closed in 2025. We own a treasure trove of beautiful yarns that we'll be creating with for years to come. Intention at Every Step Manufacturing close to home allows us to stay involved in all aspects of production, and to have meaningful relationships with the people behind our supply chain. Our process is decidedly slow and proudly local. It's not just how we make things. It's why we make them. OkayOk is committed to pushing creative boundaries, to make the most of what's possible with small scale manufacturing in Canada. Discover the Collection",

From the first layer of foam to the final stitch, each mattress reflects the care, precision, and craftsmanship Canadians are known for.Made with CertiPUR-US® certified foam—free from harmful chemicals and emissions—our mattresses meet the highest standards of safety, durability, and comfort.

Not long after, the very first Endy Mattress was delivered in March, marking the beginning of redefining and revolutionizing the way Canadians sleep.2016Benchmark for InnovationEndy was named one of Techweek’s Top 100 Innovators, an early sign that we weren’t just delivering better sleep, but challenging industry norms and setting a new standard for what Canadians could expect from their sleep.2017First Launch to First MillionMay marked our first product expansion with the launch of the Endy Pillow, designed to pair perfectly with our bestselling mattress.

Just a few months later, in December, we reached another major milestone by joining the Sleep Country Canada family in one of the country’s largest e-commerce acquisitions.2020Comfort for Frontline WorkersIn a year defined by uncertainty, we turned our focus to care. With our Healthcare Heroes Giving Campaign, Endy delivered new mattresses to frontline workers at more than 80 hospitals nationwide.2022Say Hello to HybridIn August, we introduced our second mattress, the Endy Hybrid, combining our signature Endy foam with durable pocket springs to deliver even more personalized support and comfort.2023From Online to In-StoreIn November, we opened our first retail store in the GTA, giving customers a chance to see, feel, and experience our products in person.2024Big WinsFrom our Adjustable Bed winning Product of the Year in February, to the launch of our most expansive product line, the Endy Bedroom Collection, in October, customers gained more ways than ever to build their dream sleep setup.

    "aboutContent": "About UsWe're a Canadian chocolatier with a rich history. Our founder, Richard Carmon Purdy, started selling homemade chocolates in downtown Vancouver, Canada in 1907. After 100+ years of crafting fine chocolates, you get to know a thing or two about doing it right. At Purdys, everyone - from our chocolatiers to our in-shop chocolate connoisseurs - is always inspired to take you away from the ordinary. We source premium-quality ingredients from around the world, and choose local options whenever possible. We never compromise on quality, and you bet you can taste it. Our chocolates are made with sustainable cocoa. We pay a premium for sustainable cocoa to ensure our farmer partners and co-ops are supported by programs that improve their profit and the livelihoods of their families. It's really quite simple, it's a choice we've made because it's the right choice to make. Truly Canadian and truly delicious, Purdys is a family-owned company that's proudly all about chocolate.

Reducing consumption reduces waste, so we designed our palettes to be endlessly refillable and customizable allowing you to make purposeful choices and individually buy only the products and shades you know you will use. Plus, what is better than having a palette designed by you and for you that holds all your makeup in one convenient place? Earth-FirstSustainable MaterialsWe carefully select our materials with consideration of their environmental impact which is why all palettes and refills are made with PET and PP resin, the easiest to recycle. Additionally, we use post-consumer recycled content (reusing material that already exists in the waste stream vs. using new virgin material) as much as possible. Our face, eye, and mascara refills are made with 100% PCR material, and our palettes are made with at least 50%! Using post-consumer recycled materials can be more expensive and challenging because it's difficult to work with, and our packaging was the first time most of our suppliers had ever used our requested material composition. 100% Biodegradable PackagingIdeally, packaging only lasts the life of your product, so we designed our individual compacts, jars, and capsules with a fully biodegradable material. After use, pop out refills for recycling with the Pact Collective and home compost or toss your empty packaging in your blue bin for easy curbside recycling. If you follow along on social, you may have seen us burying our compacts and powder jars in our garden where they completely turned to dirt in less than a year! THE FACTS: All of our outer packaging and shipping materials are 100% PCR from FSC certified suppliers that practice responsible forest management. Dark plastic cannot be seen and detected by current infrared optical sorting during recycling, so we included a resin called Ampacet in our palettes and lipstick refills that allows the infrared sensor to see the material. Our components are \"mono-material\" which means they are made with one single type of material. Packaging that is mono-material is much more easily recycled, and in fact many packages that use mixed materials are very difficult to recycle and end up in landfills. Earth-FirstRecyclingHow to dispose of your MOB packaging: Recycle shipping boxes and packing paper in your home bin. Recycle the outer packaging in your home bin or remove and recycle the labels and home compost the package separately. Keep and refill your palettes! Refills are too small to be recycled at home because they are smaller than a yogurt cup, so drop your empty and cleaned MOB tube, capsule, and pan refills into a Pact recycling bin. Find locations here or use our Pact mail back recycling program if you don't have access to a Pact bin. Recycled bottles waiting to be made into MOB Lip Capsules. Earth-FirstSustainability in ProgressThe beauty industry generates an estimated 120 billion cosmetic packages annually, most of which cannot be successfully recycled through your home recycling program typically because of the material composition or size. We couldn’t find a suitable recycling solution for this hard to recycle beauty packaging, so we partnered with Credo Beauty and founded Pact, a nonprofit organization that collects beauties empties that can’t be recycled in your blue bin and prevents them from becoming trash. Pact is on a mission to address the massive environmental impact of cosmetics packaging and offer truthful information and education to help you make informed and sustainable choices. Want to learn more about sustainability overall from formulas to packaging? Read HERE for more. Earth-FirstPactWe launched Pact on Earth Day, 2021, and we are so proud of the progress thus far! To date over 160 brands and retailer members from across the industry have joined, and together we have collected over half a million pounds of material! There are now over 3,300 Pact bins where you can drop off your cleaned, hard-to-recycle beauty empties, so learn more about Pact at www.pactcollective.org. We all share one planet, and together we can make a difference!

We obsess over shades and textures and are committed to continuous formula innovation which is why we never stop searching for new technology and raw ingredients. Having our own labs also means we can bring our community in to create with us, and some of our most beloved shades and formulas we’re made alongside them! We are constantly formulating, testing, and experimenting with new techniques, so follow us on social for behind the scenes! Ingredients impact performance, your body, and the planet. FormulationsConscious without CompromiseAt MOB, clean, sustainable, cruelty-free, and vegan formulas are product requirements, and with our deep roots in research and development, we deliver on these values without any compromise to performance. Taking it a step further, we leave out silicones, petroleum- based oils, and micro-plastics that are still very common in our industry and instead substitute skincare actives and nourishing plant oils which we know are better for you and our planet but also offer superior feel and performance. We take a product-first approach with the highest standards, never settling for anything less than artist-approved formulas which means great pay-off, smooth and easy to blend textures with no \"fall out\", and long wear (just some of our criteria!). We meticulously test and perfect every formula and shade with our community (including our pro-artists!) before launch. You can count on us for unique textures and one-of-a-kind modern shades.

    "aboutContent": "BEAUTY FOR EVERYONE, AGES 19 TO 99 Why does 19/99 exist? Because beauty isn’t defined by age—it’s defined by you. We believe in self-expression without limits, without labels, and without compromise. Whether you're 19 or 99, beauty is yours to define. DO MORE WITH LESS Our approach is simple: do more with less. We create multi-functional, high-performance makeup essentials for building, blending, buffing, smudging, and doing what you want. Makeup is an embellishment, an accessory, and above all, temporary. We embrace and find beauty in the smears, strokes, creases, and the time spent with ourselves to make up or just to touch up. Every product is cruelty-free, vegan, and free of synthetic fragrances. Sustainability matters to us, too. That’s why we prioritize recycled and recyclable materials while minimizing plastic use. . WHO WE ARE 19/99 is female founded, female owned, and based in Toronto, Canada. We believe beauty isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s personal, ever-evolving, and limitless. Partnering with industry visionaries Diti Katona and Simone Otis, we’re challenging outdated standards and reshaping the conversation around beauty and self-expression. This isn’t just makeup. It’s a movement. And we’d love for you to be part of it. - Camille & Stephanie, founders of 19/99 Beauty",

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Lowen’s Natural SkincareLowen’s Natural Skincare is named after our daughter, Lowen, and inspired by our journey as parents. After struggling to find an effective diaper rash remedy, Registered Pharmacist Chad Zelensky used his clinical expertise to create a natural balm using high-quality, locally sourced, and unrefined ingredients.The result? A gentle yet powerful formula that cleared Lowen’s rash within days—and it never returned. Our youngest, Simone, and many other babies have since benefited from our balms, avoiding diaper rash altogether.Realizing that many parents faced similar struggles, we set out to share our solution and help families everywhere care for their children’s skin naturally. With that mission in mind, Lowen’s Natural Skincare was born.After launching our flagship Butter Balm, we expanded our line through research and persistence to include a wide range of balms, lotions, cleansers, scrubs, hair care products, and creams. Today, we continue to innovate—developing new products to meet the evolving needs of our customers and our own family. We Formulate Our Products Based On These Four Principles Safe for us = Safe for you We formulate our products using evidence-based, peer-reviewed, and personally-tested ingredients to ensure they are safe for you and your family. We ensure that our ingredients are thoroughly evaluated for safety, effectiveness, environmental impact, and animal welfare by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Keeping it Simple We formulate our products with hard-working ingredients. What this means is that any single ingredient can provide multiple benefits within a particular product. This keeps our ingredients list to a minimum number of “simple” components. Do no Harm We do not test our products on animals nor do we purchase ingredients that have been tested on animals. Furthermore, Lowen’s has also been vetted by PETA and are listed in their Cruelty Free Company database. Sensible Sourcing We source local, certified organic and/or fair trade ingredients whenever possible and continually review and refine our practices to adhere to the above. If we are unable to find an ingredient close to home, we expand our search to find unrefined, organic, fair-trade ingredients from other community-minded social enterprises. THE LOWEN'S COMMITMENT TO YOU High Quality Only the best, most effective ingredients are selected. Unscented As a rule, our products generally do not have added scents… Traceable We investigate where our ingredients come from, what the parent plant(s) was/were, who farms it, how it’s harvested and how fresh it is Gentle Our products are gentle enough for everyday use for all age groups. Uncomplicated We use as few ingredients as possible and preferably those in their unrefined form. Therapeutic The entire Lowen’s line up can help relieve a variety of skin conditions as well as being incredible for daily self-care. Safe Prior to formulation, each potential ingredient is researched and screened for toxicity. Certified We are PETA Certified and EWG Verified™ Affordable We believe high-quality skincare should not cost a fortune and work hard to keep our costs low – which we pass on to you.",

The beauty industry wants you to feel bad about yourself. Because the worse you feel, the more you buy. It’s not kind, and we stand for kindness at Elate. We happen to think you deserve to feel beautiful just as you are—with and without makeup. By embracing diversity in ourselves and the beauty industry, we can enhance confidence, reduce waste and change the world.And as for your beauty bag? We think less is more, especially with 30% of all waste accredited to cosmetics. Curating a capsule of beloved, reusable, and recyclable products not only saves you the energy and money of cluttering your cosmetics case with lipsticks you’ll never wear, it saves landfills from unnecessary waste. If you ask us, intention makes for elation. Changing the industry together 697,000+ Plastic Packages Saved from landfills with our recycling program 157,500+ Gardens Grown from our seed paper packaging 22,000+ Trees Planted from customer orders — one for every order $27,000+ Donated to social and environmental causes in 2020 Why Elate?We’re for more mindful consumption Low-waste beauty starts with consumption. Saying no to marketing that makes you feel less than and yes to inclusive advertising that invites you to buy mindfully and minimally: When you’re ready to replenish or replace the old with the new—not before, and never impulsively. And with packaging that can be reused and recycled (and even planted), that waste-free future is within reach. We believe the makeup in our cosmetics case shouldn’t compromise the health of any person, animal or the planet. That’s why our products are 100% vegan and cruelty-free. They’re over 75% organic, but we always choose fair trade over organic when we can’t have both because it’s important to us that our farmers and their workers are paid fairly and operate safely. Organic certification is so expensive, farmers may compromise the integrity of their operation to achieve it—and that’s not okay with us. Truth? Just because packaging can be recycled doesn’t mean it is. Well-intentioned consumers may toss empties in the recycling bin, not realizing they’re too small for your typical recycling facility. At Elate, we don’t think it’s your responsibility to recycle our packaging—it’s ours. After all, we created it. Over 75% of our packaging is reusable, recyclable or plantable (we’re working on the other 25%), and all of our packaging can be returned to us (for free), so we can refill it or recycle it for you. We believe beauty is for everyone. Period. Whatever your gender identity, age, ethnicity or body type, beauty is for you. We like to think the more diverse our concept of beauty, the more inclusive our world will be, and the more empowered we’ll feel in our bodies and lives. Of course, putting on mascara isn’t going to change the world—but it may change your perception of yourself so you can. And we’re all for changing the world. So, go forth and feel beautiful. B CorporationCertified B Corps like Elate are global leaders in nurturing people, planet and profit. We use our businesses as a force for social and environmental good. Leaping BunnyAudited at every stage of product development, our Leaping Bunny certification guarantees your Elate products are cruelty-free and never tested on animals. Beauty Without BunniesFounded by PETA, Beauty Without Bunnies is a database and the gold standard for vegan and cruelty-free companies. We never use animal ingredients or tests. Think Dirty AppThe Think Dirty app is a database for rating the potential toxicity of personal care products, like cosmetics. Search any Elate product to read our ingredients and rating. Our Story Changing the world one lipstick at a time Founded by Melodie Reynolds, beauty industry insider of 20 years, Elate was born of Melodie’s penchant for kindness—for ourselves, each other and our planet. Disheartened by the unethical and unsustainable practices typical of the industry, Melodie envisioned a different future—one without shame-based marketing or single-use packaging. She founded Elate in 2014 on a mission: To redefine what “low waste” looks like in the cosmetics industry. What seems like a grandiose goal at first glance is actually modest in its practicality: It starts at home. One person, one product and one routine at a time. As Melodie always says, routine becomes ritual when the act is more important than the result. The act of intentionally choosing ethical ingredients, sustainable packaging and inclusive advertising. Choosing less over more. Choosing with kindness. The question is: How will you choose? Our CausesGiving back to our planet and people Our values in the planet, its people and animals are obvious in everything we do, from our ingredients to our packaging—but we don’t stop there. Every year, we donate 2% of our profits to causes that share our values—1% to social initiatives and 1% to environmental initiatives. We’re amplifying our impact with daily, monthly and yearly contributions to our selected charity of the year.

The product line had so much success that L’Oréal bought it in 1997.______________________________________________After Ombrelle’s skin protection products, the next logical step was to correct skin damage caused by sun exposure. It is with this in mind that the Reversa brand was created and each of the brand’s products seeks to respond to the diverse needs of its consumers. ______________________________________________Reversa was one of the first brands to use glycolic acid as its main active ingredient, but the innovation didn’t stop there. Such innovation is seen daily at Reversa, since all our products are created by our team of experts. Every formula comes directly from our laboratory in Pointe-Claire, Québec.

It was one of the most dazzlingly colourful summers in history, with all eyes on the cosmopolitan city of Montréal, who was playing host to the World’s Fair.The Fair was a kaleidoscope of cultural diversity, and a vibrant, visionary celebration of humanity.A sense explosive human potential was spreading like wildfire from the hippie love-ins of San Francisco to the ivory towers of academia in Paris.As a child of that era, Annabelle captured both its vibrant colour and its message of empowerment with the notion of Colour Power. We built a reputation for its extraordinary variety of bold shades and nuanced hues, created to inspire women to freely experiment and express their own powerful and colourful sense of personal style.Today, nearly fifty years later, the power of self-expression has reached a whole new level as women of all ages and backgrounds celebrate and share their beauty and strength on Youtube, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram. The faces and messages of the beauty industry are changing for the positive, and we’re excited to be a part of that change.Our Colour Power is stronger than ever, and it’s our dream to help women everywhere find and have fun expressing a power all their own. Annabelle believes that it’s not the way you look that counts – it’s how you look at the world. A strong connection to what makes us unique is what makes us truly beautiful. And when we bring that beauty light, it can turn even the most ordinary day into something powerfully beautiful.",

    "aboutContent": "Buck Naked Our Story Buck Naked was born out of necessity. When baby Elias, son of Buck Naked founders Rina and John, developed skin irritations from traditional baby products, they soon realized they needed a truly natural alternative. As necessity is the mother of all invention, the Chamomile & Calendula Soap was invented to help soothe the little guy’s skin. With this creation, Rina discovered her passion of formulating skin care products using the purest of ingredients. Since inception, we’ve introduced a full line of all-natural, vegan, handcrafted skin care products. We’re committed to being chemical-free, using only pure, natural ingredients. On this, we are unwavering: if you can't (or shouldn’t) eat it, we won't use it. Why Natural? Our skin is our body’s largest organ. We don't often think about it, but it’s our first line of defense against potentially harmful bacteria and contaminants. The thin layer of sebum that covers our bodies works like an invisible shield. At 22 incredible square feet, our skin deserves to be nurtured and nourished with the best quality of ingredients. However, our skin is also porous, which means that between 13% (the bottom of our feet) and 100% (underarms and groin) of the products we put onto our skin is absorbed within 26 seconds. Although federally-approved, many traditional products contain a variety of chemicals that soak into our skin and bloodstream in that 26-second window and potentially disrupt our bodies' natural balances. Some chemicals, like sodium laureth sulfate (a detergent and lather booster), can contain contaminates that are considered possible human carcinogens – harmful to the nervous system, and classified as possible developmental toxicants. This is why Buck Naked Soap Company makes only natural skin care products. [Read more…]",

Our choice to prioritize reusable and recyclable packaging aligns with our values of responsible business practices, ensuring that the beauty we provide comes with a commitment to preserving the beauty of our planet for future generations. How it started: Founding Story It all began with our adventurous mom's remarkable solo trek across South America, a six-month journey that unfolded six years ago. Debbie, the pioneering spirit behind Birch Babe, embarked on an awe-inspiring hike from the southern tip of Patagonia to the northern reaches of Chile. Amidst the breathtaking landscapes, she couldn't help but witness an alarming amount of waste. While traversing Patagonia, Debbie appreciated the locals' conscientious attitude toward the environment. Already mindful of what she applied to her skin and consumed, she had grown skeptical of the skincare industry's lack of transparency and social responsibility. The transformative experience ignited a fervor within Debbie to contribute more to both our bodies' well-being and the health of the planet. Returning home, she immediately immersed herself in crafting cleaner, more responsible skincare and body care products. What began as a personal pursuit soon extended to friends, and eventually, Birch Babe products found their way to festivals and stores nationwide. Enter Debbie's daughters, Kelsey and Lindsay, both driven by a passion for environmental stewardship and making a positive impact. Joining forces, they transformed Birch Babe into a female and family-led company, infusing it with a commitment to authenticity, transparency, and a shared mission to foster a healthier world for generations to come. Birch Babe can now be found in over 200+ stores across North America, on Indigo.ca, Well.ca and has been seen on CTV’s The Social and CNN.

FOUNDER'S STORY When asked how I got started in this business, I often find myself reflecting on the journey that has unfolded. What began as a hobby in my kitchen, turned into our family’s full-time livelihood. It’s been an exciting adventure; one that I believe is part of a greater plan and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to continue leading and growing Pure Anada. My professional background began in hairstyling, where I enjoyed the creativity of working in a salon and the relationships I built with clients. However, over time I began to develop sensitivities to some of the products and chemicals commonly used in the industry. I found myself relying on prescription creams for my hands and taking daily allergy medication just to get through the day. Growing up, I was always conscious of health and wellness, thanks to my mother who taught me the value of nourishing the body with wholesome, natural foods. As a child, I was the one bringing homemade whole grain bread and apple juice from our family orchard to school. She instilled in me a deep understanding of the importance of what we put into our bodies. This awareness led me to the realization (once I became a mother myself): if what we consume matters, then surely what we put on our bodies matters too. In 2003, with two young children at home, I made a conscious decision to embrace a more holistic lifestyle, eliminating many household and personal care products in favour of healthier, more environmentally responsible alternatives. The final conversion was my cosmetics! I had always relied on high-quality salon brands, so I struggled to find natural makeup that covered my rosacea to my satisfaction. Driven by a lifelong passion for creating things with my own hands—whether it was sewing, baking, or crafting—I decided to try making my own makeup as well. What began as a personal project quickly gained momentum. I researched natural, organic ingredients and started crafting makeup for myself, my friends, and my family. It was eye-opening to discover how many people, especially women, were sensitive to conventional cosmetics. It seemed our bodies were signaling, “Enough with the chemicals!” Even more rewarding was realizing that the products I was making, using organic botanicals and food-grade minerals - did not cause irritation. This reinforced my belief that there was a growing demand for natural, safe alternatives in the beauty industry. As consumer awareness of the ingredients in personal care products continued to grow, it became clear that this was more than just a personal passion; it was a business opportunity. Today, I am proud to lead a company that offers high-quality, natural cosmetics that make people feel beautiful without compromising on safety. The story of our family business has been nothing short of amazing. From mixing products in my kitchen to now operating in a fully equipped facility with a dedicated team, we have come a long way!

    "aboutContent": "It all started with a real need... and a lot of pain 😖 In 2016, the life of our founder, Jeremiah Curvers, took an unexpected turn.A diagnosis of a double herniated disc forced him into immobility for three months.Nailed to his bed, unable to move, he was faced with a physical and mental challenge. But sometimes, stopping is the starting point of a revolution 🧠 Being in bed nonstop day and night sucks 💩 But it's in those hard times that genius ideas come alive.Jeremiah realized just how much sleep was misunderstood, underestimated, and even corrupted by the products supposed to support it.A question emerged that became an obsession: HOW CAN WE DEEPLY AND SUSTAINABLY IMPROVE PEOPLE'S SLEEP?Still in bed (it still sucks), he set about creating solutions with a local factory in Montréal, Canada. Not a prototype or two, but 22, before perfecting our first product, the Polysleep Mattress. That’s how Polysleep was born 💜 What began as a personal mission (and obsession to perfection 😝) became a Canadian sleep movement in the next years, helping thousands of people rest better every night.Polysleep is proud to be one of Canada's fastest-growing mattress brands, and the only vertically integrated sleep company in Canada to manufacture its own foam recipe. In the last decade, we served thousands of happy customers online and in-store in North America. We believe in wellness through sleep and in doing business with purpose. %22 Less CO₂ Studies estimate a savings of 80–100 kg of CO₂ per 100 mattresses shipped in boxes (like ours 💪). 62 Prototypes developped To provide the best solutions to real problems. 611 + Mattresses & pillows donations Through our cross-Canada charity network. Returned mattresses get a second life - donated to someone in need through our network of Canadian charities. We craft sleep that’s good for you and the planet. Our secret sauce? Earth-friendly materials and shipping so efficient it makes Tetris jealous. We fit 6 Polysleep mattresses where others squeeze in just 2. Less truck space, less carbon, more high-fives. Internally, we thrive on diversity, creativity, and equality.Everyone here is encouraged to dream big and make a difference, just like the idea that started it all!!! Also, sleep is part of every stages of life Polysleep wants to be there, every step of the way. In the easy times, but also in the hard times.Not just to sell a mattress, but to offer real support. A cocoon, an anchor, a tool for resilience. Every night, somewhere in Canada, someone experiences a life-changing moment... and we're there, silently, to support them.

    "aboutContent": "Our Founder - Meet Lane PURA started because I felt so passionate about innovating beauty care products that I could trust. It was ingrained in me from a young age with a mother and grandmother who were both knowledgeable and wise in herbology, wellness and nutrition. My beloved mother lost her heroic battle to an autoimmune disease in 2013. Losing her has made me even more protective of women's health and longevity. When I was expecting my first baby, I became extremely sensitive to all of my conventional beauty products, especially synthetic scent. I couldn't find a skincare line I truly loved. I felt compelled to innovate a luxurious, plant-powered line. Growing up, I'll never forget the bliss of dipping my toes into her bubble baths, and her sensorial nighttime skincare routine. I can still remember the smell of her night cream from when I kissed her goodnight. As a mother of three, I'm my own customer who craves a clean skincare ritual that calms, heals, and repairs. From filling orders as a mad scientist in my unfinished basement, to shipping our products worldwide, being chosen to be Fleetwood Mac's official skincare for their last world tour, or seeing your reviews come in, we are a proud Canadian-made brand. Thanks to our loyal community who inspire me daily, we have never felt more loved and empowered to help women feel confident in their own skin and to age with power. Thank you for supporting a little girl's dream who had a potion step at the side of her home, and for trusting PURA to be a part of your invaluable self care rituals and healthy skin. In pure we trust. With Love,Lane Edwards Founder & Director Pura Botanicals Inc.",

Although I had access to the ‘best’ skincare products, I could never seem to manage my own skin struggles: extremely sensitive, reactive and breakout prone. I started creating my own with plant-based formulations and saw a drastic improvement in the health of my skin. Without much consideration, I quit my job, maxed out my credit cards and began a three year journey of intensive study into the world of natural cosmetics. My passion, vision and excitement for green beauty took hold.

    "aboutContent": "FOUNDED AND FORMULATED BY WOMEN IN STEM+BAbout Veriphy SkincareBorn out of a lucky science experiment gone wrong, Veriphy Skincare was founded by a group of women who saw the power in a vegan form of glycogen. We're built for professionals by professionals with the cleanest ingredients. We want to give people clear, radiant skin so they feel confident in every step of their life, career, and beyond. Clinically proven ingredients for real resultsOur PhytoSpherix® Technology has been clinically proven to strengthen skin and provide visible improvements. It's not just a marketing claim. Natural ingredients for healthy skinWe use only natural ingredients in our luxury skincare products, ensuring that your skin is nourished and healthy. No harsh chemicals or synthetic fragrances.

No animals harmed and no harm to the planet. Award-winning qualityOur brand has been recognized for providing high-quality, effective skincare products that deliver real results. Trust the experts and try our award-winning products. A note from our CEO\"I spent two decades trying to prove myself in business and in my life. I worked endless hours, read countless self-growth and business books, and looked for every life hack to figure out how to ‘be successful.’ One day, I realized that when I felt truly confident and comfortable with myself, life felt like it got easier. I earned more respect from colleagues, more opportunities came my way, and I was generally happier. I became obsessed with figuring out ways to increase my personal confidence, and having great skin was one of them. It was part of the first impression I gave to the world and helped fuel a deeper confidence that had lay dormant inside of me. My quest for glowing, radiant skin led me to discover Veriphy, a small, clean skincare line with an innovative plant-based form of glycogen at the heart of each product. This unique ingredient we now call PhytoSpherix® has been proven to give amazing results; from 130% increase in skin hydration to 97% of people having more radiant complexion, this ingredient is the future of modern skincare. I fell in love with this small brand not only for their powerful range of products, but also for the support they showed to women in STEM +B (Science Technology Engineering Math + Business). Something inside felt strongly about helping this brand to grow and expand. I wanted other people to experience the amazing skincare results and feel the confidence that great skin could give them.So I decided to invest in the company and am now on a mission to help more people remember how powerful they actually are. I know that with great skin we have the confidence to do great things. Imagine what you can do when you feel like the best version of yourself.\"Lindsay Nahmiache, Owner & CEO Veriphy.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story: 22 Years of Intentional Beauty Cocoon Apothecary began in 2003 with one belief: nature holds the intelligence our skin needs most. Since then, founder Jessica Burman has spent two decades studying aromatherapy, perfumery, and plant science to create skincare that’s luxurious, ethical, and deeply effective. Where It All Began In 2003, a simple natural cream transformed a loved one’s skin and changed Jessica’s life. The following year, she earned her Aromatherapy Certification, studying how plant essences affect both skin and mood. This was the true beginning of her formulating career — blending art, science, and a deep respect for the skin’s natural balance. Learning the Language of Scent To refine her craft, Jessica travelled to Provence to study at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery — the historic home of fine fragrance. Among lavender fields and distilleries, she learned to compose scent with restraint, emotion, and respect for sensitive skin. These lessons shaped Cocoon’s signature aromatic identity: perfumes of purpose, not overpowering fragrance. Mastering Plant Distillation Later, in Spokane, Washington, Jessica studied plant distillation under world-renowned distiller Ann Harman. Working hands-on with copper stills and fresh botanicals, she learned how to capture the purest expressions of plants. That knowledge lives in every Cocoon formula — in the way our ingredients are chosen, extracted, and combined. Two Decades of Conscious Craftsmanship 2003Cocoon Apothecary is founded in Kitchener, Ontario. 2004Jessica earns her Aromatherapy Certification and begins formulating in earnest. 2006One of Canada’s early online natural-skincare stores goes live, sharing ingredient transparency before it was mainstream. 2011Awarded Champion Status with the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, a coalition of 150 non-profits who worked to elimate dangerous chemicals from personal care. 2014Our own factory and retail shop opens, maintaining production in-house for full control and traceability. 2020We begin getting our products certified Natural and Organic with Ecocert Cosmos. 2023Cocoon Spathecary opens as our sensory flagship spa, built around the formulas our customers already love. What Defines Cocoon Scent with PurposeSubtle compositions that uplift the senses without overwhelming sensitive skin.Performance You Can FeelBotanical actives that restore radiance, balance, and barrier strength.Integrity in Every DetailECOCERT COSMOS, Canadian manufacturing, glass packaging, and a bottle return credit program.Longevity Over HypeTrusted, proven formulas refined over 22 years — not driven by trends. “My goal has always been to make skincare feel like a ritual — something you look forward to every day.”— Jessica Burman, Founder Join the Ritual Cocoon Apothecary isn’t just skincare. It’s a philosophy — one that celebrates nature, craft, and the quiet luxury of living intentionally. Experience what 22 years of care, study, and conscience can do for your skin.

    "aboutContent": "What inspires a man to launch a rocket into space? What compels him to flex his biceps to Hulk Hogan proportions? And what greatness causes a man like SMOKE to create the most gastronomical dish of all time? Legend has it, the same reason for all of MANKIND’S GREATEST FEATS – to win the affection of a girl. Yes, a girl. Smoke spent days and nights turning the precious Canadian Poutine into a TOTALLY BITCHIN’ CONCOCTION that would win over the tastebuds of a Molly Ringwald look-a-like so he could moonwalk straight into her heart. He cut potatoes with the determination of Wolverine’s retractable claws, he smothered them with gravy and cheese curds, but he didn’t stop there, oh no! In a LOVE-STRUCK CRAZE he added double-smoked bacon, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and pulled pork. He presented the box to his sweetheart and it was LOVE AT FIRST PLASTIC FORKFUL. The taste had THE POWER OF 100 MIXED TAPES and they wed immediately. Smoke realized that he couldn’t keep this secret to himself, that he could use it to help ALL OF MANKIND. Thanks to the power of his Poutine, he was ready to answer the call of grumbling stomachs far and wide. After all, the love of POUTINE NEVER DIES. THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE LEGEND WHAT IS POUTINE? Smoke’s Poutinerie is the World’s Largest & Original Poutinerie offering a broad menu exclusive to Poutine. The Smoke’s Poutinerie Vision is to achieve GLOBAL DOMINATION by providing a Unique, Canadian Food Experience that will Entertain the World! Smoke’s Poutinerie has taken the Iconic Canadian dish of Fries, Cheese Curd and Gravy and has created an entirely new food category complete with unlimited variations of topping ingredients to choose from. Whether your preference is beef, chicken, vegetables, pork or simply a different type of sauce, Smoke’s Poutinerie has the recipe for you! POTATOES Thousands of acres of Smoke’s Grade A, locally sourced potatoes are hand-picked and distributed in our own Branded bags by Smoke himself! The hand-cut fries are thoroughly rinsed, then blanched on low heat in trans-fat free canola oil. The fries crisp up quickly and brown when cooked on high heat to be made fresh to order every time! GRAVY Smoke created his own recipe by adding some subtle seasonings including a hint of rosemary to the classic chicken-based Quebec gravy. This flavour profile is one that you’ll never taste anywhere else. We also offer Veggie Gravy. CHEESE CURDS Smoke’s cheese curds are made according to his strict specifications, which are white, glistening nuggets that are always fresh & squeaky. Put it all together and you have a delicious concoction of golden crispy fries, squeaky cheese curd and piping hot gravy topped with an assortment of tasty toppings. VIEW THE MENU",

    "aboutContent": "OUR SOAPY STORYHi I'm Kat—the maker behind aweSOAP! ​ My journey to soapmaking wasn’t exactly typical. I started out as a biotechnologist, working in chemical and food manufacturing, but over time, I realized I wanted something different. I wanted to create clean, natural products—something truly good for the skin, free from harmful chemicals, and made with intention. What began as a passion project in my kitchen quickly grew into aweSOAP, a brand dedicated to beautiful, effective, and non-toxic soaps, candles, and skincare. Every product I make is a blend of science, nature, and artistry, using premium ingredients, natural colorants, and pure essential oils to craft something special. But aweSOAP isn't just my business—it's a family effort. My loved ones have been by my side every step of the way, from testing products to helping with packaging and markets. Their support and encouragement fuel my passion, making aweSOAP more than just a brand—it's a reflection of the love and care we put into everything we create. ​ Now, three years in, aweSOAP has become more than just a business—it’s a way for me to share my love for high-quality, skin-loving products with people who care about what they put on their bodies. Whether it’s a bar of soap infused with botanicals or a candle that fills a space with warmth, every item is made with passion, integrity, and a whole lot of love! Thanks for being here and supporting my journey—I can’t wait for you to experience aweSOAP! ​ With gratitude, Kat",

    "name": "Petland",
    "url": "https://www.petland.ca/",
    "screenshot": "/brand-screenshots/petland.png",
    "aboutContent": "At Petland our guests are assured that we will counsel them in finding the right companion pet for them and the right products to enhance their enjoyment with their pets. We hope that you will become part of our team and help us make that happen. If you ask the coach of a football team how he motivates winners, he’ll tell you that you can’t motivate winners; you have to recruit them. The desire to win, to be the best you can be, is essential to success in life. If you have that desire, we can show you how to channel it. It’s one thing to love animals. Its’ something else to be able to care for a whole store of them. And it’s something else altogether to be able to meet new people, to talk to them about their wants and needs in a pet and them help them to make a decision – the right decision – about meeting those needs. It’s all in the timing... The Petland team begins their work sometimes two or more hours before the store opens and they continue after the store closes. Everybody has a position and each person must be there on time and in uniform. We are open almost every day of the year. Even when we are closed the pets in the store must still be cared for. That means someone must feed them clean up after them and provide special attention on Christmas, Easter and every other holiday. Everybody works week nights and weekends. That’s when most of our guests are here. You won’t have to work them all, but you will be required to do your fair share. If for some reason you can’t get to work on time, it is up to you to call in with plenty of advanced notice So, the first questions you need to consider for this job are: What hours are you available to work? Can you be flexible? Can you get to work on time? Clean, clean, clean Everybody who inquires about working with Petland loves animals. If you don’t love animals, you won’t like working here But caring for hundreds of animals in a store is different than caring for one or two at home. It’s a lot of work. Everyone a Petland must clean. Everyone comes in contact with waste matter. It’s a part of nature; it’s part of the job. Look the part Did you ever find yourself in a store where you needed help, but you couldn’t tell the difference between the customers and the people who worked in the store? Have you ever needed directions, but you didn’t want to ask the people around you for them because you didn’t know them? Sure you have. Everybody is reluctant to talk to strangers, and everybody looks for clues as to who is safe and knowledgeable when they want information. That’s why we wear uniforms at Petland and that’s why we require our members to follow strict uniform code. We want all of our guests, not just a portion of them, to feel comfortable when speaking to any member of our team. While you are on the job, you will be expected to wear the Petland uniform. Someone will tell you later what constitutes the full uniform and what parts you will need to supply. For now, we want to note that when on the job, our guests expect you to look approachable. That includes a clean, pressed uniform and also a welcoming smile and good eye contact. They should feel comfortable when you approach them. A pet counsellor’s mandate is to develop relationships with their guests. So consider these questions: Are you willing to wear the uniform? Are you willing to look the part? I’ll be there You may be asked to report to work before 8:00 am. You may be asked to work after 9:30 pm. You will be expected to work on Saturdays and Sundays. The question is: can you get here on time, and can you get home? Everyone must provide their own means of transportation. Whether it is by bus, bike, car or foot, a Petland team member must be on the job every time and on time or they will let the rest of the team down. Do you have a reliable way to get to and from work? Opportunity The first Petland pet counsellor was hired in 1967. Since that time, pet counsellors continue to play significant roles in the growth of Petland and the pet industry. Many have gone on to own and operate their own Petland stores. Several have become corporate team members, even executive vice presidents. In the highest levels of most pet supply companies, you will find someone who began their career in a Petland safari uniform. Petland has opportunities for advancement to the pet counsellor who can understand our culture and enhance it. There are Petland stores throughout Canada, the United States, China, Japan, Mexico and South Africa. We are an industry leader and you can have a career here! Everyone on our team is asked to memorize our Mission Statement. It summarizes our philosophy. It reads as follows: Our pet counsellors are dedicated to matching the right pet with the right customer and meeting the needs of both. To our customers who already own pets, we are dedicated to enhancing their knowledge and enjoyment of the human animal bond. Our culture At Petland, we set ourselves apart from other retailers in several ways, but it all begins with the team members we hire. The foundation of it is our desire to make a difference in the communities we serve. For more than 38 years Petland has been the retail pet industry leader in the area of animal care, with ongoing staff training programs, in-store animal care systems and community service programs aimed at placing homeless pets and curbing pet overpopulation. We are committed to our communities. We are involved in many worthwhile causes, such as spay/neuter campaigns, pet food banks spay/neuter campaigns, pet food banks National Service Dogs and many more. We have developed strong relationships in every community we serve with our local humane societies, independent rescues and animal control services. We are dedicated to ensuring that none of our pets ever become a burden to any animal shelter. We are also dedicated to providing the knowledge and education necessary to ensure people and their pets enjoy happy lives together. We have fun! Our dedicated teams are made up of caring animal lovers, just like you. Our pet counsellors also know that they need to really enjoy people; not only the ones they serve but also the ones that they work with! That’s why if you don’t like listening and interacting with people (and not just pets) you probably wouldn’t fit in with our team. While we do have a great time working, we never lose sight of our goals and our purpose. There are many opportunities for personal growth and career advancement at Petland Your potential here is unlimited! GAP: The 3 principles that guide everything we do Guest Service: Our focus on guest service allows us to provide our guests with the information they need to make the right choices for their pet and their care. By delivering a superior experience, we have become a resource for pet owners and a place where people who love pets want to shop Animal Care: Our focus on animal care ensures that we are providing the best quality healthy pets available to our valued guests. Teamwork and communication plays an integral role in the overall well-being of the animals in our care. We understand that our animals rely on us to find them their forever homes. Our objective is to inspire our guests to want to adopt our socialized, happy pets! Presentation: Presentation of a Petland store and presentation of our team members, is of primary importance to our company and to our guests. The perception of a Petland store begins before we even open the front door. As a Petland team member, making sure the store is inviting, clean, well merchandised and that all of our staff are in clean, pressed uniforms, will ultimately result in our guests wanting to return Of course, it also feels really good to work in an environment you can feel proud of We know you’re the right fit when.. You understand that hard work and dedication to guest service, animal care and presentation are required for the success of our stores You believe in doing your very best for every guest You know that ongoing education and training are the foundation of your success You want to be part of a fun and caring culture in a company which promotes responsible pet ownership and community awareness You engage with guests and enjoy being around people with whom you have things in common You are committed to upholding Petland’s high standards There are many positions to apply for...",

Built For Good Times The Keg has always been the backdrop for your celebrations, big and small and for no reason at all. Explore our timeline below to learn more about our storied history. Our MissionTo be the first choice of individuals who love steak by allowing Keggers and guests to be themselves. Our Story In 1971 our founder George Tidball opened the very first Keg under the name Keg n’ Cleaver in North Vancouver. He did so with one simple formula in mind – elevate the every day for our guests by surrounding great food with good times. The Beginning | 1970's The Keg gains momentum as classics like The Keg Caesar and the Billy Miner Pie join the menu. The Keg becomes known for ‘good times’ and the famous phrase “See You Tonight” is coined. Transition | 1980's George Tidball’s run as owner comes to an end, as he sells The Keg to UK-based company Whitbread. The Keg’s first patio opens on Leslie Street in Toronto and the internal staff event ‘Keg Cup’ expands its reach to eastern Canada, marking an annual national tradition. Keg Bread becomes the infamous start of a great night out. A New Vision | 1990's The Keg’s Chairman, David Aisenstat, acquires The Keg and transforms it into what you know today – accessible, upscale, and consistent dining driven by an internal culture that can only be found here. The Keg focuses on heightened hospitality and sees the inception of a ‘Keg Classic’ meal. Keg Size Growth | 2000's After more than 30 years of business, The Keg opens its 100th location. Reflecting on our history of giving back to communities across North America, The Keg Spirit Foundation is formed, focusing on charitable giving towards youth and development programs. The Keg retail products are also launched, allowing guests to enjoy some of The Keg experience at home. Soaring High | 2010's The Keg experiences its strongest years as a brand, seeing sales reach all-time highs while being recognized as one of Canada’s top employers for each year of the decade. The brand continues to expand throughout North America. Cheers to Fifty More | 2020's After a half century of good times at The Keg, we celebrate our 50th Anniversary – here for a good time and a long time; cheers to fifty more!",

    "aboutContent": "Company History Ben Moss Jewellers was established in 1910 as one of Canada’s first independent and family-owned fine jewellery store companies. It unfortunately suffered from external forces that left it financially vulnerable in recent years and a wholesaler acquired the chain in 2013. The company filed for creditor protection in May 2016, and closed all stores. In January 2017, Charm Diamond Centres acquired the rights to the trademark Ben Moss and is re-opening 16 Ben Moss Jewellers stores in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. Founded in 1972 by Richard Calder, Charm Diamond Centres, with Crescent Gold and Diamonds, is Canada’s largest independently owned and operated jewellery company. Under these three retail banners, Charm operates more than 88 stores and employs more than 800 people from Newfoundland to B.C. Charm’s mission is to ‘Win the Customer for Life’ by providing quality, value, and trusted service to all its customers. Charm Diamond Centres is a Canada Top 50 Best Managed Company. Charm Diamond Centres has great respect for the Ben Moss Jewellers legacy and its long history. Like Charm, the company has a similar story – it is a family-owned Canadian fine jewellery brand that customers have trusted for their most treasured memories.",

    "aboutContent": "Nothing but the Good Stuff In 1986, two young brothers opened a retail outlet at the Promenade Mall in Toronto, Canada. It was a modest effort: a small store with a great design and a strong concept that impressed one of Canada’s largest mall operators who wisely decided to take a chance on a new tenant with no track record. A concept was developed that consumers immediately loved, and a strong following pursued. The name Yogen implies yogurt, of course, and Früz calls forth “frozen”, “fruit” and “fresh”, all of which play a part in the Yogen Früz concept. REALLY, REALLY GOOD We are a healthier, better for you lifestyle brand. Today with our new assortment of proprietary probiotic frozen yogurt and our dairy and non dairy smoothies, as well as our light ice cream offering, we continue our strong tradition of market innovation/leadership. NATURAL With our Flavürs menu, the fruits natural colour and natural sugar is preserved in a product that is as creamy as soft serve, and comparable to or better than the best super-premium ice cream, anywhere in the world. All natural, nothing artificial. HEALTHY Our products come in low fat vanilla, low fat chocolate, non fat, no sugar added and non dairy bases. It’s the perfect attributes for today’s health conscious consumer. When the consumer discovers that the product tastes so good, and has a fifth the fat and half the calories of ice cream, Yogen Früz creates a friend for life. It’s a product and a system that appeals to people of all ages – men and women alike. FLAVOURFUL The frozen yogurt is pre-packaged in single serving bars, comes in vanilla and chocolate flavours. The selection of fruit, which is used for blending with the yogurt varies and depends on local availability and customer preferences. Yogen Früz has also developed new flavours, combinations and tastes of Smoothies, which can be consumed as a nutritious breakfast, lunch or snack. Ü CARE WE CARE Yogen Früz is proud to be part of the communities where we live, work and play. Giving back to our neighbourhoods and supporting local initiatives helps to inspire positive change. Yogen Früz Brain Project is a large-scale, outdoor exhibit that brings brain health, art and imagination to the streets of Toronto. As the 2018 & 2019 Title Sponsor, this campaign brought brain health and diseases like Alzheimer’s to centre stage in over 15 locations across the city. The Yogen Früz Brain Project brings together artists from around the world who transform blank brain sculptures into beautiful, energetic and thought-provoking pieces of art. Funds raised are donated to the Baycrest Foundation, the fundraising arm of Baycrest, a global leader in brain health and aging.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Hey there! I’m Heather, the founder of BUFF Snacks, a proudly woman-owned Canadian brand built on bison sized boldness in all aspects of life and business. I’m a mom and stepmom to four amazing teens, wife to my biggest supporter, and a full-time food lover. Feeding people has always been my love language, so it’s not surprising that my winding path led me here- creating better ways to help people snack! When I’m not running BUFF, I also run an agri-tourism business with my husband (redneckranch.ca) that revolves around a huge U-pick garden, and our funny farm animals- another way for me to share my passion for quality, local food. How BUFF Started BUFF began because I didn’t love what was out there for my meat-loving kiddos. I was tired of scrolling endless aisles of snacks that pretended to be healthy but were really packed with sugar, fillers, and buzzwords instead of real nutrition. BUFF was born from years of curiosity - bringing in meat snacks from across North America in 2014, studying how they were made, and learning what worked (and what didn’t). Between running a farm, wrangling kids, and trying to grab something quick that didn’t taste like cardboard dipped in marketing jargon - I knew there had to be a better way, so, I made one! I created something I was truly proud of - something I was happy to feed my kids. Not junk disguised as “natural,” but real, high-quality protein snacks made the right way. What started as a mom’s mission turned into a movement: snacking that’s simple, real, and ridiculously good. Real Protein for Real Life! Why Bison? Because bison are strong, pure, and unapologetically wild- exactly the kind of energy I wanted in a snack and in life! Our meat sticks are made with Canadian-raised bison (as well as beef), naturally fermented, and cold-smoked to perfection. No mystery meat. No lab-coat ingredients. Just real food that fuels you the way nature intended. Woman-Owned. Boldly-Run. BUFF isn’t backed by corporate buzzwords or venture capital. It’s backed by grit, humor, humility, and heart and the belief that women can raise kids, build businesses, and raise standards…all while packing a mean meat stick! So whether you’re chasing kids, goals, or adventure- grab a BUFF stick for the ride. Because life’s too short (and too busy) for fake snacks. Thank you for your support! Whether that’s picking BUFF up in your local grocery store, ordering online, or giving me a silent high-five when you spot our packaging in the wild. Every bit of it means the world to me! ❤️ Heather, Founder of BUFF Snacks",

About Gillian & Joe Thrive Protein is owned and operated by myself, Gillian House, and my partner Joe Clark. We first met in the fitness industry through our employment at a local gym in our hometown of Collingwood, Ontario, and realized each other’s passion for health, fitness, wellness, and nutrition early on. We worked alongside each other for a number of years, and during that time started a family. We have two little girls—Grace, who is 3 years old, and Alice, who is just a few months old. We have always had an incredible working relationship, and our strengths complement each other’s weaknesses, which has allowed us to run all facets of our company with just the two of us. We live together in Collingwood, Ontario, where we also run Thrive. Why we started Thrive Protein We first decided to start Thrive Protein because we were frustrated with the lack of high quality fitness supplements in Canada, particularly in the plant based sector. I personally struggled to find a great tasting plant based protein powder that had the macronutrient profile I was searching for, without fillers, sugars, or preservatives. I knew I was not the only one who could not find the right product. Shortly after launching our plant based protein, we became aware of the demand for high quality, great tasting super greens in Canada, as many greens are very overpriced and do not taste good. From there, we expanded our product line to many different health and fitness supplements and are always developing new products and ideas. Since launching, we have built a customer base of likeminded people building their health and wellness pursuits. It is the support of our customers that has affirmed our vision of producing the highest quality, best tasting, all natural fitness supplements in Canada. We simply produce the products that we want to use, as we know there are many others like us, searching for clean, great tasting, optimally formulated, Canadian made supplements. Our Process 1 Product idea~All of our products are ones we use personally. As athletes and health enthusiasts, we use a broad range of supplements, and this is what inspires our product line. Any supplements we use but don’t yet carry are planned for development over the next few years! 2 Development~Next, we send our formulation to our manufacturing partner, who produces a sample for us. We then go back and forth, tweaking and adjusting the formula until it is just right. 3 Production~Once we’re happy with the design, we enter production. This takes place in Woodstock and Windsor, Ontario. Joe designs the labeling, which is also printed in Ontario.Once the batch is produced, a blind sample is...",

Plus, Get a Free Mini Wallet with a $105 purchase. No code needed About Pela Our Story & Mission Why? Here at Pela we have a big, hairy audacious goal. We want to create a waste free future.We believe that the technology exists to make our BHAG a reality, it just takes the right company with the right community to make these products the new normal.This is why we are developing products made of environmentally sensible materials. To educate and inspire the global community of people who are committed to making a positive impact on our planet.Put simply, we believe in better.Everyday Products Without Everyday Waste™ Origin Story This all started with Jeremy Lang, our founder. He saw first hand the damage plastic was doing to our oceans while on family vacation in Hawaii in 2008. Jeremy had the courage to spend years experimenting with new materials to try and find an alternative to plastic that could be used in everyday products I started Pela when my son Cole dug up some plastic on the beach in Hawaii and I started wondering about the impact of plastics on our planet.Our mission to make sustainable products the new normal starts with a product that you hold everyday. Phone cases help to protect your investment (phones are expensive!) but they shouldn't be just another plastic product made with materials that could carry toxins into your home.Our cases are tested to be free of BPA, lead, cadmium and phthalates. If we can make products at a higher standard to keep our family and planet safe, shouldn't we?I just want to make sure that I do my best to protect the planet (our home) for my children and their children and the future generations to come!\" — Jeremy Lang, Founder of Pela Loading video... Our Values It’s one thing to have a strong mission and purpose, it is another thing entirely to create and nurture the team and community required to make this waste free future a reality.This is why we created our core values. To help us and our community stay the course.These are the 4 “C’s” we’ve curated. We hope they mean as much to you as they do to us. Community Commit to a culture that builds a vibrant community.We want to play, have fun, and laugh together. We want to engage in meaningful debate, to have the right conversations so that we can create value for ALL of our stakeholders. We call this ‘taking care of the whole’. Everything we do together must be good for us as individuals, as a team, as a business, for our community and ultimately for our planet. There is no planet B.Two quotes that inspire us:“We are the people we’ve been waiting for.”“We will rise up through our children.” Creativity Foster creativity to inspire innovation.Better is born from creativity. The only reason things are the way they are is because other people made it that way. Which means with a little bit of creativity we can make things better. Consciousness Live with awareness and consciousness of the impact of our choices.We are mindful of the impact of even the smallest decisions.We are grateful for both the opportunities and the challenges we face.We are humbled by the lessons learned in both wins and losses.We are concerned only with what’s right instead of who’s right. Courage Embrace courage by taking action despite uncertainty.To disrupt traditional ways of thinking and challenge the status quo, you need courage. It allows us to accept that we don’t know everything, but we’re willing to learn and try the seemingly impossible.Meaningful impact is made when you are willing to tackle bold initiatives in which there is a chance of failing.Coming out with a black eye doesn’t mean we are weak, it means we were not afraid to take a shot at something worth doing. Value Propositions Made with Plants + Compostable Our cases are made from flax shive and a plant based biopolymer which break down naturally without harming the environment. Made in Canada Over 80% of our cases are made at our Kelowna Sustainability Studio, where we also recycle materials, test compostability, and develop new products. Planet Friendly Non-toxic, BPA-free products that are safe for you and gentle on the planet.

When outside 5G and 5G+ areas, LTE speeds may be accessed where coverage is available. *Currently available in areas of Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, London, and the Greater Toronto Area.6. Network CoverageBased on Freedom and our Nationwide partner network coverage across Canada. See Coverage Map for details.7. Student Offer Offer is available for a limited time at participating Freedom Mobile locations and is subject to change or cancellation without notice. $44/mo. is based on a $49/mo. plan after Digital Discount, less a $5/mo. student offer credit for 18 months. To be eligible for the student offer, you must activate a new line on an eligible plan (in-market eligible Canada-U.S.-Mexico 100GB + 5G+ and Roam Beyond 15GB and up plans) and have a promo code applied during the promotion period. You must be a student of an eligible post-secondary institution and, during the new activation, must: (i) show proof of enrollment (either a student ID or enrollment letter), (ii) use an eligible student email address on the account (each email address can only be used once) and (iii) create a new 1-line account (new lines on existing accounts are not eligible).

You will receive a $5 credit off the monthly plan price for 18 months as long as you remain active on an eligible plan. Each promo code can only be used once and applies to one line only - not the full account. The promotion may not be combined with other in-market recurring discount offers, except for Digital Discount and the $5/mo. credit for 18 months. Your service will no longer be eligible for the discount if you: (a) change your rate plan to a non-eligible plan, or (b) change your email address from a student domain to an ineligible domain.

Instigators of change. We invented men’s pouch underwear nearly 20 years ago.And we’ve been changing men’s lives ever since. We confront the uncomfortable. We take on men’s intimate problems with boldness and tenacity. We fix them. And we deliver life-changing comfort and support.Men have been dealing with discomfort for decades. But it was SAXX’s founder, Trent Kitsch, who recognized men’s discomfort and innovated to solve it. In 2006, Trent Kitsch was on a fishing expedition and after spending hours in a cold, clammy ocean suit he knew there had to be a better way to protect his package from uncomfortable chafe.As a former baseball player, he imagined a catcher’s mitt hammock design turned upside down and built into his underwear. After the fishing trip, and with the hammock idea still percolating, he worked with a seamstress and designer — and himself as the fit model — to create a paneled fabric hammock that separated his balls from his legs. Fourteen prototypes later, the BallPark Pouch® and SAXX Underwear were ready to change men’s lives. It’s an imperfect world but here are some of the ways we commit to making it better.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Have you ever wondered why a pair of sunglasses costs as much as a weekend getaway?Yeah… me too. I didn’t question it much until early 2025, when I was packing for a golf trip. I reached into the bottom pocket of my bag and found my $300 sunglasses—now sporting a fresh, deep scratch courtesy of whatever junk accompanied it. It wasn’t the first time something like that had happened. And at that point, I had to ask myself:Why am I replacing expensive glasses that go out of style next year and I just perpetually destroy. I cursed the establishment, hoped on amazon and bought a pair of glasses that look decent under 50 buck. They arrived… and the quality matched the price. The lenses were terrible, the frames were flimsy, the fit was questionable at best. But here’s what really got me: they weren’t that different from the $300 pair.Same basic parts. Same hinges. Same weight.One was just priced like rent. After the trip (Mexico), and some recovery, I dug deeper. The Industry No One Talks About A few late-night rabbit holes later, I learned the truth: the eyewear industry is controlled by one mega company. All those “different” brands? The ones we grew up thinking were independent, cool, or local? All owned by the same corporation, no joke, its actually wild, ask chat gpt. Here you don’t even have to type it. “Tell me about the one company that owns the eyewear industry”. Wild eh? They control the design, distribution, manufacturing, retail—everything. And they inflate prices because they can. When you’re the only game in town, who’s going to stop you? Suddenly, the $300 price tag made a lot more sense. The Breakthrough Moment As my Amazon glasses expired and summer was approaching fast I continued to an off brand, high quality reasonably priced pair of glasses. One where if the style changed next year, or I destroyed them again I wouldn’t fee to bad about getting a new pair next year. Googling “Canadian eyewear brand”, notta. Actually, the only Canadian eyewear brand that made a momentum was bought out by you know who and shut down the next day. What else I found in my search, was an ad labelled: “Canadian Eyewear distributer for sale – In business 50 plus years” A little research and I saw the solution to my glasses problem! (and everyone elses) This amazing family owned business was supplying Canadian retailers with eyewear to resell to the consumer. These were the same manufacturers that produce for the big brands.The same factories.The same equipment.The same relationships… without the inflated price tags. Everything clicked. In a quick 30 day close, I took over Boléro Eyewear—determined to build something better. What We’re Building We took the best styles we could find and upgraded them with the features that actually matter: Metal-core frames Spring hinges Premium polarized and non-polarized lenses Custom designs made in the same factories as the “luxury” brands And price points for everyone and every style. The difference?We price everything as low as humanly possible — not because we’re cutting corners, but because we refuse to play the monopoly’s game. For far too long, people have paid $300 for a piece of plastic with a fashionable logo slapped on the side. We’re done with that. And you should be too. The Mission Our goal is simple: Make great eyewear accessible.Expose the markup.Deliver premium quality without the premium price. We’re just getting started, but we’re building a new kind of eyewear brand — one rooted in honesty, transparency, and giving a damn.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Fourth-generation Syrian refugees bring centuries-old art of soap making to Calgary Abdulfatah Sabouni is a fourth generation soap maker. Making soap has been his family business for more than 125 years. Even his last name, Sabouni, means soap maker. The centuries-old tradition of Aleppo soap making — which uses no chemicals or other additives —involves secret family recipes handed down for generations. In the 11th century, the Crusaders brought Aleppo soap back to Europe, starting a centuries-long love affair with the olive-oil and laurel oil based soap said to be intensely moisturizing. Aleppo soap is thought to be one of the world’s oldest types of soap, and also said to have been the inspiration for the equally famous Marseille soap of France. Although claims of its great antiquity abound, such as references in the popular press to Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and Queen Zenobia of Syria using Aleppo soap, these claims have yet to be verified by Scholarly method. Traditional soap factories in Aleppo were either destroyed or abandoned, creating a worldwide shortage of Aleppo soap. Newspaper headlines appeared in Europe, Saudi Arabia and Japan, where the soap is highly coveted. When Sabouni arrived in Calgary two years ago, his entrepreneurial dreams were never far from his thoughts. He threw himself into learning English and got the ball rolling, and opened Aleppo Savon to great success. The business continues to grow, and they have big plans for distribution across Canada and North America. For Sabouni, making the world-famous Aleppo soap is his way of giving back to a city and country that has given him and his family so much. <div id='ndrsl-wol-5fb60d339cf2854b761806dd' class='ndrsl-widget'></div> Founder and Owner of Aleppo Savon and His Family Officially Become Canadian Citizens After coming to Canada in 2016 to escape the Syrian war and provide a better life for his family, owner and founder Abdulfatah and his family become official Canadian citizens on January 5th, 2022. https://globalnews.ca/news/8491443/calgary-syrian-refugee-family-canadian-citizens/ Recommended For You Aleppo Soap 20% Laurel Oil - 4 PCS with New Packaging Aleppo Soap 20% Laurel Oil - 4 PCS with New Packaging Regular price $29.97 Regular price Sale price $29.97 Unit price / per Unscented Liquid Soap - Hand and Body Wash Sale Unscented Liquid Soap - Hand and Body Wash Regular price From $9.99 Regular price $15.00 Sale price From $9.99 Unit price / per Sale Famous Aleppo Soap 10% Laurel Berry Oil Sale Famous Aleppo Soap 10% Laurel Berry Oil Regular price From $13.99 Regular price $42.00 Sale price From $13.99 Unit price / per Sale Peaches & Cream Liquid Soap - Hand and Body Wash Sale Peaches & Cream Liquid Soap - Hand and Body Wash Regular price From $11.99 Regular price $15.00 Sale price From $11.99 Unit price / per Sale",

    "aboutContent": "About Nutrience Nutrience took its name from the word ‘science’ and the word ‘nutrient’ from the latin word ‘nutriens’ meaning to nourish or feed. These guiding principles have led Nutrience to providing dogs and cats with complete and balanced diets for over 30 years. Proper nourishment has been at the core of Nutrience’s philosophy and continues to fuel its innovation. All Nutrience formulas meet the nutritional standards set by AAFCO with ingredients that are humanely raised and sustainably harvested. Here at Nutrience, we believe that a healthy lifestyle begins in the bowl. Produced in Canada Crafted in small batches in our very own kitchen located in British Columbia, Canada, Nutrience formulas are made with locally sourced proteins, fruits, and vegetables. Our 9.98 million square kilometers of endless lakes, rivers and forests stretching from the Maritimes to the British Columbia coasts provide us with some of the best raw ingredients for our dog and cat foods and treats. We take great pride in sourcing fresh poultry, meats, wild-caught fish, and produce directly from Canadian farmers, ranchers and fishermen –chicken and turkey from Fraser Valley; beef and bison from the Prairies; or any of the wild-caught fish that is plentiful in the cold, clear waters of the Pacific Northwest. Quality is Our Promise to You Every bag of Nutrience is produced at a Safe Quality Food Program level-3 facility. This ensures that we follow the highest possible standards within pet food manufacturing, equal to that of human-grade facilities. Every batch made passes the most rigorous testing procedures, subscribes to the most stringent food processing policies, and is double-checked by third parties for safety. Now in its second generation of family ownership since 1955, the company is part owner in its own pet food facility as the means of providing absolute assurance that its Nutrience brand promise is kept - the promise of food made from quality ingredients that truly nourish pets to live a healthier and longer life. Since 1955 Since its founding, Hagen, Nutrience’s mother company, has made it its mission to produce the highest quality food on the market.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story From a young age, I began asking questions about food. What was in it? What was its environmental impact, where did it come from, how was it made, and, most importantly, was it nourishing? Just because the foods I had eaten were commonly accepted and consumed, did that mean they should continue to be? After all, what is the point of food if it does not provide nourishment on a fundamental level? Can’t we just eat real food? I am far from alone. Thankfully, more and more people have also been concerned about our food as our health becomes more of a priority. Unfortunately, the food industry does not always address these concerns and continues to churn out products with minimal improvements dressed up in marketing claims and campaigns to distract from the truly meaningful changes that are needed. While I was a ballet dancer in California, I developed a deeper desire to understand how food impacts our bodies. I was already a vegetarian and loved learning about new ways of eating and culinary techniques. I was exposed to the raw vegan diet and I fell in love with its sorcery. Raw produce was turned into flavourful dishes like pastas, crackers, sauces and desserts. It was like magic! NUDFUDNUDFUDNUDFUD After my ballet career was ended by injury, I returned home to Canada and continued to explore my passion for holistic nutrition and the culinary arts. As I continued to fine-tune what I ate and experimented with different ways of cooking and eating, I developed a deep connection to the environment and animals and also felt better than I ever had before. Because I was so passionate about real, wholesome food, I realized there were not many products on the market that met these standards. The more and more research I did on packaged foods, the more I was shocked by what was being passed off as “food”. As a result, I was inspired to make my own food products that were honest and derived from whole, simple ingredients that made people feel good because that’s what I know people deserve. The good news is that providing people with real, healthy food can be done. You could say I founded Nud Fud in protest to what I saw in the food industry, but also as a way to share what I’ve learned about whole, healthy foods in the hopes that we can all start feeding ourselves the way we deserve. Committed to quality above all else, all of Nud Fud’s ingredients are organic, raw, vegan, paleo, tree nut-free, gluten-free, grain-free, and non-GMO. You deserve whole, healthy, and delicious foods without compromise – just the Nude Truth. Our Mission Nud Fud is on a mission to improve lives through food. We will never compromise on our product purity, its quality, ingredients, or nutrition. We will never use weird ingredients or create false claims. Of course, we won’t always be perfect, since we are charting new territory making food without preservatives, natural flavours, sweeteners, industrialized ingredients, or extracted oils, but we will always promise to try. Meet Our Team Julia Kirouac, CNP Holistic NutritionistFounder/CEO Julia is passionate about nutrition/food (of course!), the environment, animals, and seeing women succeed. When she is not working, she loves to spend time with her husband, where they spend most of their time eating, cooking and eating some more. (Food is really the only form of entertainment!) Her favourite animal is a dog (super basic we know), but she really does love all animals and creatures.",

    "aboutContent": "How the Magic Works Authentic, Guilt-Free TasteAt Fiber Gourmet we use 100% wheat in our products which is why they taste just like the unhealthy alternatives, giving you the same delicious taste and texture you know and love. How do we pull this off? Over 90% of the calories in wheat flour come from its starch. Starch molecules are really long chains of sugars. Enzymes in your body release sugars from the starch during digestion, sending the sugar into your bloodstream and throughout to your body.With a few subtle alterations to the starch, we can make it a lot harder for the enzymes in your body to release the sugar, keeping them locked away and out of your body. This stops you from getting the blood sugar spike (and crash) that you typically get from a carb-heavy meal, and effectively converts the bloated calorie-packed starch into a lean calorie-free fiber. By making our pasta out of a mix of this improved starch (now called modified wheat starch) and the original protein from the flour (vital wheat gluten), we can increase protein and fiber while reducing net carbs and calories.Low Net Carb and Low Calorie:Less than HALF THE NET CARBS and approximately HALF THE CALORIES than the leading brand. Enjoy everything you want in a great plate of pasta, rice pilaf, or flour product with less of what you don’t! Beneficial Fiber:Our fiber packed products keep you fuller for longer without causing bloating, while also producing butyric acid, which has many health benefits. Great flavor and great nutritional benefits can finally meet! See more details below. Trailblazers in the industry The Fiber Gourmet Mission is to welcome you back to the foods you love. Since 2007, we’ve been reinventing your favorite foods with fewer carbs and calories, without sacrificing flavor or texture, using our patented formula. See our full line of products so you can welcome back the foods you love! Women Owned Our business is certified women owned, and we are also family owned and operated. Our family tested over 2,000 formulations until we found the perfect combination of healthy and delicious. We’re so proud to be able to share the fruits of our labor with you! 10% Profits to Charity At the heart of Fiber Gourmet lies a strong commitment to philanthropy. In 2022, Fiber Gourmet contributed products valued at $150,000 to charitable causes, and they have made an ongoing commitment to donate 10% of their annual profits to charity. To this day, Fiber Gourmet has generously supported various charitable endeavors, with a particular focus on education that prioritizes the development of each individual child, aiming to empower future generations. Fiber Gourmet makes real pasta. Not pretend-to-be pasta. No gummy textures. No nutty aftertaste. No mushiness. Buy Now Transform your well-being. Feeds gut microbiome.RS4 passes through the stomach and small intestine to reach the colon. There, it converts into short-chain fatty acids, feeding good bacteria. Manages hunger cravings.Fiber from RS4 is a natural appetite suppressant that helps you feel fuller for longer, meaning less snacking and more weight loss. Controls glucose levels.Having a high blood sugar level is not good for your health. RS4 can help with this by bypassing digestion and reducing average levels over time. Permission to indulge RS4, the recipe for gut health. Every product features RS4, a good-for-you fiber-boosting starch that weighs in at a slim 0.4 calories per gram. Stack it up next to traditional flour at 4 calories per gram and you’ll see why this fiber-packed starch has become a fan favorite.How it WorksInsoluble fiber doesn’t go through the process of digestion like soluble fiber, and many other foods; therefore, it does not provide any calories to the body. Instead, insoluble fiber passes straight through the small intestine to the colon without being digested. Regular starches contain calories because we digest them and use their glucose for energy. But since our bodies don't digest insoluble fiber, it doesn't directly give us energy and therefore its caloric value is slashed. What are its Benefits?Insoluble fiber often doesn’t get the recognition it deserves, as most people don’t know exactly how great this unique fiber is. Insoluble fiber has several important benefits: Not only do insoluble fibers not add to the calorie count, but they can also be an excellent resource for helping to control weight after meals. Insoluble fiber triggers hormones that make you feel fuller, helping you to eat less. An additional significant benefit of fiber is the role it plays in preventing constipation. Constipation is not just uncomfortable, but it may lead to hemorrhoids. Lastly, studies show that insoluble fiber can help lower blood sugar, boost gut health and reduce cancer risk.Fiber Rich DietOne of the challenges that a lot of people face is adding the right amount of insoluble fiber to their diet. Most Americans don't get half teh recommended DV of fiber. Fiber Gourmet is proud to bring you many healthy fiber-filled options to incorporate a good selection of fiber-filled foods into your diet. 100% Science-Based. Resistant Starch has been validated by hundreds of clinical studies to improve blood sugar, weight loss, gut health, cholesterol, and more. See case study On a mission to close America’s fiber intake gap. The American Heart Association recommends a total dietary fiber intake of 25 to 30 grams a day. Currently, dietary fiber intakes among adults in the United States average only 15 grams a day. (about half the recommended amount). Lab Analysis Scientists found that resistant starch cuts the risk of hereditary cancer by 60%.

    "aboutContent": "About UsAbout Our ChocolateNo Sugar Added Chocolate At Ross Chocolates, we create premium No Sugar Added Chocolate for those with diabetes and others striving to eliminate sugars from their lives.Our chocolate has the smooth, rich taste of premium chocolate that chocolate lovers crave without added sugars that increase caloric intake and blood glucose levels. Sweetened with stevia and a touch of erythritol, our newest line of chocolate – with only 2.6 net carbs per bar – has virtually no impact on blood sugars and up to 17% fewer calories than chocolate sweetened with sugar. Our legacy maltitol line has been made for 25 years and continues to be a favorite of many of our customers. This chocolate for diabetics is very popular as it is suitable for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, those on keto and low-carb diets, and, of course, those wanting to eliminate sugars from their diets.Try each of our bars — or a pouch of our minis — to discover how good No Sugar Added chocolate can be.Ross Chocolates — Quit Sugar, Not Chocolate! Shop NowOur Social ResponsibilityCommitment to Diabetes ResearchRoss Chocolates has always supported the diabetes community in many ways, including sponsorship of JDRF and Diabetes Canada events and research and committing a portion of each sale to diabetes research. In the area of research, we also participated in a study with the University of British Columbia in 2021 in which our dark chocolate was given to diabetics (T1D and T2D) to determine if it had any effect on blood sugar levels. We are happy to report that our dark chocolate flavors do not affect blood sugar levels to any noticeable degree.In addition, during 2021, we started supporting our cocoa farmers through Cocoa Horizons, an organization that works with Cocoa farmers in remote equatorial locations to ensure sustainable and profitable operations, so their farms and communities thrive.Finally, in recent years, we have expanded our community support to many local, small, non-profit organizations by supplying chocolate gifts and baskets for fund-raising events. Our Company HistoryHow Ross Chocolates Was Born In 1995, our founder, Bob Ross – a chocolate lover for years – was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Although he now had to avoid eating sugars, Bob was determined to continue enjoying chocolate: Bob set out to create premium chocolate without any added sugar- and with that the perfect chocolate for diabetics.Based in his home in Scotch Creek, BC, Bob worked to find the perfect combination of cocoa beans, cocoa butter, and diabetes-safe sweeteners to make great tasting diabetes-friendly milk and dark chocolate. In 1998, Ross Chocolates began marketing No Sugar Added Chocolate bars for diabetics and others wishing to eliminate sugars from their diet.Ross Chocolates quickly became popular and we ship millions of bars across North America and the world. For 17 years, Bob continued to create new flavour combinations, eventually having 9 flavours of maltitol-sweetened chocolate bars.In 2015, Bob Ross reluctantly retired from chocolate making and Ross Chocolates was bought by a group of chocolate lovers who moved the production facility from Scotch Creek to a larger facility in Port Coquitlam, BC. Ross Chocolates has grown from a small chocolate operation in Bob’s kitchen into one of North America’s leading makers of No Sugar Added chocolate.Today, Ross Chocolates continues creating the wonderful chocolate that Bob Ross always made. We have also created a new stevia-sweetened line of chocolate to create new offerings that are even easier on blood sugar levels than our original bars. In the true spirit of our founder, we continue to develop new No Sugar Added chocolate treats for those striving to eliminate sugar from their lives.Ross Chocolates — Quit Sugar, Not Chocolate!

Each piece has been consciously thought, designed and crafted. Comfort, aesthetic, protection and sustainability are the main priorities. Regarding fabrics: all laces come from France, more precisely from family lace makers in Calais-Caudry or Lyon. They have a real know-how and this for centuries. The quality and the fineness of the lace is one of the highest and it can last years. ÔDE wants to guarantee a non-harmful garment, so all the materials are certified Oeko-Tex. It is a label that guaranties non-harmful substances. And last but not least, production: All our pieces are proudly crafted in British Columbia, Canada. We cut and sew everything in our studio for capsule collections or we work with local atelier when the collections are bigger.

Your Store: Find A Store Contact Us Flyer Sign In 0 Now Shipping to BC Means you Always Get the Best Price With a Dedicated Service Team Home About Us About Us Over 115 Years and GrowingFounded in 1909 by Ablan Leon, the A. Leon Company started out as a general merchandise store in the small town of Welland in Southern Ontario. Today Leon's is one of Canada's largest retailers, selling a wide range of merchandise including furniture, mattresses, major appliances and electronics. The company continues to be run by the Leon family and maintains the standards of service, integrity and dedication established by Ablan Leon over 115 years ago. Leon’s Furniture Limited is proud to employ over 10,000 associates within our network of corporate and franchise stores throughout Canada.Our HistoryCanada's GainAt the turn of the century, a young Ablan Leon left his native land to seek his fortune. After a few years of extensive travel throughout South America and the United States, he settled into the small town of Welland in Southern Ontario. The largest town on the Welland Canal was a busy and prosperous one with large ships passing through the canal, connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.Mr. Leon began his career by selling clothing from a suitcase door-to-door. After saving enough of his hard-earned profit, he bought a small building in the working class area of town and The A. Leon Company was born in 1909. Merchandise such as pants, blankets, shoes, linens and other soft goods, were sold at a fair price to his growing list of customers. The Company quickly established its reputation for being honest, honourable and caring with special attention paid to standing behind the goods sold.A Helping HandIn the early 1900s, immigration levels were steadily rising and many of these new Canadians had difficulty obtaining credit of any kind. One particular policy that enabled the store's reputation to grow, was to provide credit to customers who were unable to receive it elsewhere. This endeared Mr. Leon to a growing number of loyal customers.Once he was on sure footing with his new venture, Mr. Leon went back to his native land to take a bride, Lena. Ablan brought Lena to Welland and they started their family of 11 children. It was evident to everyone who dealt with this family, that Christian ideals such as kindness, humility, and a general concern for others were deeply ingrained in their daily lives.As the children grew, they worked in the store dusting the furniture, sweeping the floors, or washing the front picture windows.The Accidental ShopperWhen Ablan's son was to be married, he decided to purchase the couple a mattress from a local department store. When the mattress was delivered, it was leaned against the store's outside wall. Soon after, someone came into the store wanting to buy it. Because it wouldn't be needed immediately by his son, Ablan added a few dollars to his cost and sold the mattress. Considering that most of his sales provided only pennies in profit, he was amazed how much could be made on larger items. The rest, they say, is history.A Family AffairWhen Ablan Leon died in 1942, the operation of his now thriving business became the responsibility of his children. Brothers and sisters worked diligently to continue the legacy left by their father. As sales grew, additions were put on the store to accommodate a bigger selection of merchandise.Eventually it became apparent that in order to grow even further, the business had to expand to other centres. Soon, stores began appearing throughout Southern Ontario, all bearing the Leon's name.The reputation of Leon's as an honest, reputable retailer who provided quality merchandise at low prices became more and more ingrained in the minds of customers.Expanding Across CanadaTaking on TorontoThe largest city in Canada provided great potential for further expansion. Rather than open their own stores, the family strategically decided to purchase the business of an existing retailer with a good reputation. They felt this was the best way to break into this highly competitive market in order to learn the intricacies of retail.After a few years of learning the ropes, Toronto stores were opened under the Leon's name. The family was fortunate to have associates in all their stores who were dedicated to the success of this growing organization, while it worked through many challenges. Leon's Toronto stores soon became synonymous with great values on a gigantic selection of brand name merchandise.Leon's Brings \"Big Box\" to CanadaIt became clear that to capitalize on Leon's growing presence, a new wave of expansion was logical. This would require a significant injection of capital. In 1969, Leon's Furniture went public and was listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange. The family retained the majority ownership of the shares while individuals as well as institutions, all well aware of the Company's growing reputation, snapped up the balance.In 1973, Leon's opened the first warehouse showroom in all of Canada. This massive 150,000- square-foot building was the first example of \"big box\" retailing in the country. For the first time ever, customers had access to a multi-million dollar inventory that prevented long delays in obtaining their purchase. This bold new retail initiative was promoted heavily on television through a series of commercials, including one that used a helicopter to show off the immense size of the store. The buying public accepted this radical new approach with open arms and the Company began erecting huge new showrooms across Canada.Leon's TodayLeon's TodayToday Leon's Furniture Limited has grown to become one of Canada's most highly respected retailers. Leon's consistent growth of sales and profit is the envy of other retailers across the land.Even with consistent growth, the Company has not lost sight of its beginnings or the reasons for its success. Leon's continues to sell high quality brand name furniture, appliances and electronics at guaranteed lowest prices. Leon's take great pride in its after sale service, and relies on the professionalism and support of thousands of associates across Canada. This team of associates is Leon's greatest asset.Leon's Furniture has become an integral part of Canadian homes. The Company remains committed to continued growth in sales and profits for the benefit of its shareholders, Company associates and customers.With multi-million dollar inventory levels, Leon's provides customers with almost instant delivery. Computerized systems and procedures are on the leading edge of retail technology.Leon's award-winning advertising provides our customers with all the information needed to make a thoughtful and satisfying purchase. The marketing department continues to be emulated by other retailers who attempt to recreate the same winning formula that has taken nearly a century to develop.Leon's thanks you for visiting our website today, and we look forward to serving you.Community SupportThe Leon’s Leaf Project is our commitment to help rebuild Canada’s forests devastated by record-breaking forest fires.Leon’s will plant 10,000 trees and provide customers the opportunity to donate seedlings starting from $5 which will be planted in partnership with Tree Canada.

    "aboutContent": "The LouLou Lollipop journey Our Story Designed to Love. Born to Last. We know how precious those first few months and years are. Our safe, sustainable, and so sweet baby goods are made to last (and love). Designed with durability and functionality in mind, our products are tried and tested by parents like you. That means you can be confident they will hold up, no matter what life (or baby) throws at them. Our commitment to the highest safety and sustainability standards and family-first focus means you can feel good about everything you find here. How It All Began We got our start in 2015 with our first two designs, the original silicone Donut and Ice Cream Teethers that broke the mold for safety, durability, with a sweet aesthetic that fit seamlessly into our homes … but the fun was just getting started. We’ve continued expanding, but stayed committed to quality and accessibility. All of our products are ASTM, CPSC and CPSIA compliant, because every little one—and parent—deserves the best. Featured in Milestone Moments2015: Our Magical BeginningWe're fearless pioneers, always willing to try new things in pursuit of better, cuter, and safer products. We launched our first product out of our home office with help from our husbands. Milestone Moments2016: Out On Our OwnWe moved from an Etsy shop to our own website, attended our first trade show, started selling to boutiques, and expanded our offering to include our first muslin swaddles. Milestone Moments2017: We All Scream For Ice CreamWe launched our iconic Ice Cream Teether (a design that’s been copied many times), and moved into an office space of our very own. Yay! Milestone Moments2018: Growing TogetherWe moved into an even bigger office with a warehouse to keep up with exciting growth—and grew our staff to a team of 18. Milestone Moments2020-2021: Apparel & MoreWe perfected our first line of apparel, launched silicone tableware, and before we knew it, we had over 2,000 unique product offerings. (This called for a bigger office, warehouse, and team.)

You can really tell these pieces are handmade and of the highest quality! The milk and cookies print is just the cutest!” - Katie S.\"I had the best experience purchasing from KEWE Clothing! I bought multiple pairs of the pocket leggings and had actually bought some of the simple leggings on sale in bigger sizes and when the package arrived they had upgraded us to the pocket leggings in the bigger size for no extra cost because they had sold out of the sale leggings! It was the best surprise!\"- Katlyn K.\"Everything is so cute and the quality is amazing. Great customer service and my order arrived right on time. Will definitely shop again. Thank you!\"- Alejandra OFFSETING YOUR EMISSIONS CARBON NEUTRAL DELIVERIESWe have partnered with Grassroots Carbon to offset carbon emissions on every order through regenerative agriculture.Regenerative agriculture mimics wild herd migration patterns through a process called adaptive multi-paddock grazing. Land managers use livestock, which include bison, cows, goats, and sheep, as tools in this process. These animals are rotated frequently through pastures, which gives the plants time to “rest” between grazing periods. By letting the plants rest, it keeps the animals from being able to graze on a single plant to the point of destruction.During these rest periods, plants return to full health. The restoration of these healthy plants ensures that the land remains covered with plant life, which ensures carbon capture and drawdown, but also promotes biodiversity, improved water retention, erosion mitigation, and supports wildlife. ONE TREE PLANTED FOR EVERY PRODUCT SOLD Restoring the planet together 3,500 TREES PLANTED Since starting this initiative, together we have planted nearly 3,500 trees!!Thank you for supporting our small business.You are making an impact.

Petits Genoux began as a happy accident in between drop off and pick up at preschool, between another mom and I. A super stylish travel writer and myself, creating pieces for our #newprojects. In a few months we had a line and a few weeks later, an order and then voila, Petits Genoux was born. No plan, no bank account, no website, but we pulled it together and had an opening in our first vendors boutique and I was right back into the swing of things. A vast new, shiny space called Childrens Clothing was breathing a new vibrant energy into me. The entrepreneurial spirit is a bit of a phenomenon to some. They question the struggle, the inconsistencies, the highs and deep lows. Those are the things that keep me in it, it’s like survivor or the amazing race, non-stop and never ending. I am a creator, and and don’t think I will ever stop. I pride myself in the quality and integrity of my work and hope when it goes out into the world that it’s received that way because, it really is in my blood... I hope you these pieces bring you joy.

Eco-conscious, socially-conscious, and gender-neutral, Petits Genoux is great gifting for any child. ***************************************** An accomplished designer, creative director, stylist, and entertaining expert, Kendra began her multifaceted journey in fashion design. Her designs are characterized by impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail. Her distinctive approach, rooted in simplicity and thoughtful execution, has now expanded to all facets of life and the art of living.

    "aboutContent": "Our mission: Make Specialty Coffee Accessible to More People (In More Ways) by Crafting Exceptional Direct Trade Coffee, With Intention, that Inspires Curiosity. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, 49th Parallel endeavours to sustainably source and craft exceptional coffee. We are a technologically advanced roastery with a science forward approach to the craft. We strive to collaborate with enthusiastic, satisfied customers while positively contributing to the health of local and global ecosystems. We do this through motivating, recognizing, and rewarding every part of the value network - viewing each of our partners as valued team members. From origin to our roaster, into cafés and kitchens, it is human togetherness in every part of the process that makes the coffee we represent possible. OUR VALUES We Create Exceptional Specialty Coffee & Customer Experiences We are Inclusive, Respectful, & Celebrate Teamwork We Aspire to Positively Impact Coffee & our World We are Curious & Adaptable We are all Aligned to our Mission & Committed to Bringing it to Life OUR ROASTERY Our state of the art roasting facility is a coffee professional's dream. We currently roast coffee on five different roasters of various sizes and engineering. We have carefully collected these tools over the years to highlight different roasting techniques and accentuate different flavour profiles. Roasting highlights the qualities inherent in the green coffee. Coffee is a drupe, a stone fruit and just like grapes for wine, there are thousands of different varieties growing in various regions around the world. No two coffees are the same and the potential for flavour complexity is immense. Our goal as a roaster is to work with individual varieties and express them in a delicious, balanced cup, showcasing each coffee’s unique qualities and characteristics. QUALITY CONTROL TEAM Our focus goes far beyond roasting and preparation, to the source of the raw material: the green coffee bean. Every coffee comes from a farm, and we want to provide the most direct link between our customers and that source. We want the tasting experience to be built around the knowledge of who grew the coffee, what variety, where on their farm, when it was harvested and how it got here. Our offerings reflect the seasonality of coffee. Our in-house coffee buyer travels directly to farms to evaluate and select coffees. At cupping labs both at origin and in our roastery in Burnaby, each lot is carefully tasted and graded. Because we are working with seasonal harvests, each lot is limited in availability, and thus as fresh as possible. Our coffee menu changes throughout the year and each coffee is presented at its peak of flavour.",

    "aboutContent": "Our Story We’ve been around for a while, and that’s a good thing The Bean was born in an era when we still listened to cassettes in our cafés. More importantly, it was also the era of Vancouver’s “second-wave” coffee boom. West Coast coffee culture is thriving, but it’s also relatively new – since we opened our flagship store in West Vancouver during B.C.’s coffee awakening in the ‘90s, we like to think we’re among “the originals”. We’re about good people and good coffee Since the beginning, we sought out the best beans and the best people that the coffee industry had to offer. People seem to appreciate that, and we’ve been growing ever since. In 1994, we opened up our roastery, which allowed us to provide that iconic Bean Around the World taste to an increasing number of shops. We’ve now got 23 locations around the Lower Mainland and a bounty of loyal coffee subscribers who get their beans by delivery.",

We weren’t just buying beans — we were aligning on a vision. To build something better. Something healthier. Something delicious.We founded Two Bears because we saw a gap in the market: high-quality, great-tasting drinks that actually do something for you. No added sugar. Real ingredients. Packed with protein. Convenient for real life.But more than that, we created Two Bears to prove that you don’t have to choose between health and taste. You can have both — and look good doing it.We’re proudly Canadian. Fueled by nature. Ferocious about crafting drinks that raise the bar.To us, “ferocious” means chasing what lights you up — whether it’s coffee, adventure, or building a life that makes you feel alive.So whatever you’re into, be bold.

So, reusing plastic again-and-again for single-use items such as juice bottle seems likethe best idea ever, no?At DOSE, it’s a tremendous step forward to reduce our environmental footprint.From now on, all our bottles will be entirely made up of PCR plastic (Post Consumer Resin).

I’d get my smoothies from cafes near me but they were always packed with added sugar and unhealthy ingredients that left me feeling bloated and tired. So, my partners and I joined forces with a mission: to solve this smoothie dilemma for busy folks like me. Our solution? Frozen, pre-portioned smoothies that are not just tasty and packed with goodness, but also ready in seconds. NOUR KAISS, CO-FOUNDER + CMO “ Empowering people to build healthy eating habits Smoothies that are good for you and the environment Making healthy food accessible to everyone Always balancing taste and nutrition IT ALL STARTS FROM WITHIN What you put inside your body matters From the very beginning, our mission has centered around the profound impact of your food choices on your well-being and performance. That’s precisely why we’ve dedicated ourselves to crafting smoothies composed of the finest, vitamin-rich ingredients. Our goal is simple: to transform your life for the better with every sip. We don’t eat enough fruits & veggies According to the CDC, a mere one in ten individuals manages to meet the daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. At our core, we’re committed to making it effortless and convenient for you to embrace a broader spectrum of superfoods through our perfectly portioned smoothies. Frozen to lock in the good stuff Right from the start, our vision was crystal clear – we were going to craft our smoothies using frozen ingredients. Why the emphasis on frozen? Well, it all boils down to the supply chain. You see, the path that fresh produce takes from the farm to your table spans weeks, and during that time, fruits and veggies can lose over 30% of their nutritional goodness just three days after being harvested. By freezing produce right at the source, we lock in those essential nutrients and flavors, ensuring that every sip of our smoothies maximizes the benefits you reap from every delicious gulp. Building healthy habits with intention It all begins with your determination. When you set your mind to it, you take the first step toward cultivating healthier habits. Our goal is to help you maintain that consistency without the hassle of shopping, portioning, and prep work. We handle all of that so you can concentrate on what truly matters – a healthier, happier you. And it all starts with a sip of our nourishing smoothies.

    "aboutContent": "Share Link We recently shared some of the science behind sweat and electrolyte loss, highlighting the necessity and importance of replenishing key electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride) after physical activity and exercise. Having a clear understanding of how we lose electrolytes was crucial when it came to formulating our own, and though we found that most electrolytes were lost through sweat, there was another contender: drinking alcohol. We had heard about the correlation between drinking alcohol and electrolyte loss before, but wondered how could we be losing electrolytes just by consuming a liquid? Is there any truth to the claims that electrolytes are a great hangover cure after a night of heavy drinking? The truth is, alcohol, regardless of its type, has a major impact on the absorption, elimination, efficacy, and concentration of essential electrolytes and minerals within the body. As a diuretic, alcohol consumption triggers diuresis, a condition characterized by increased urine output, and tricks our kidneys into flushing out water by blocking the release of natural hormones needed to control fluid and electrolyte levels. Generally speaking, the intensity of alcohols diuretic effect is largely determined by the strength of the alcohol consumed. This means that spirits with a higher alcohol content like vodka, whisky, and rum dehydrate us faster than drinks with a lower alcohol content like beer, coolers, and wine. However, drinks with a lower alcohol content tend to be consumed in greater volumes, and can quickly add up to have the same dehydrating effect that would occur when consuming a stronger alcohol. The more alcohol we consume, the more likely we are to experience its dehydrating effect, often being left with a headache, feeling tired, thirsty, nauseous, irritable, or in other words, hungover. Though hangovers may seem like an inevitable outcome of drinking alcohol, the truth is we can easily fight back by keeping ourselves hydrated before, during, and after consumption. A simple glass of water between each drink can go along way, but rarely provides enough hydration to fully counter alcohol effects. With WakeWater Electrolytes we wanted to change this, providing an electrolyte drink that can actually keep up with your electrolyte loss. With 800mg of sodium, 800mg of chloride, 400mg of potassium, 50mg of magnesium, and 50mg of calcium in each serving of WakeWater Electrolytes, you can say goodbye to hangovers and say hello to rapid rehydration! To learn more about WakeWater Electrolytes, visit the page below or send us an email to have any of your own questions answered! We’ve just introduced our newest WakeWater Electrolytes flavour, Blue Raspberry, and hope you enjoy it as much as we do! WakeWater Electrolytes - WakeWater Beverage Co Back to blog",

    "aboutContent": "Why are eyeglasses SO expensive? The short answer is, monopoly. The giant in the industry dictates markup and pricing, operates many optical chain stores and supplies the independents. If you've worn glasses for years, chances are, you have purchased one of the brands (Rayban, Prada, Oakley) or shopped at one of its retailers (Lenscrafters, Sunglass Hut, Clearly, Eyebuydirect ....). We believe that we can do better than that. We can offer options. Real options. In 2012, we launched iLookGlasses.ca with one goal in mind: bringing premium-quality eyewear directly to Canadian consumers at accessible prices. How? We do so by cutting out the middleman and sourcing directly from independent frame & lens manufacturers. We do not run costly TV advertising campaigns or high-profile sponsorship programs. We do not have high overhead costs associated with running brick-and-mortar stores. By maintaining a lean and mean operation, we are able to offer competitive pricing and pass the savings directly onto our customers. What about quality? We uphold consistency in quality by developing and maintaining long-term partnerships with our suppliers. We stand behind our products with a one-year warranty program. We are confident that our customers will be happy with their purchases and come back to us when they look for their next pair of glasses. How about style? Do I get more style with designer frames? Well, don't take our words for it and have a look for yourself! We offer a wide variety of styles, from classic, everyday, retro to high fashion. Instead of having one pair of expensive designer glasses, you could own several pairs from iLookGlasses and have some fun switching things up. Everyone else will think that you paid much more than you actually did! Sounds good to you? We look forward to hearing from you! Your Stories I am very impressed with this company. I just received my three pairs of glasses and I was so nervous. This is the first time I ordered prescription glasses on line. I ordered prescription sunglasses and regular sunglasses progressive transitions and absolutely love them! I even love the free pair of aviator sunglasses I received. I cannot be any happier with this company right down to their chat line. I will definitely be ordering again. Sandra Victoria, British Columbia click HERE to view more testimonials",

    "aboutContent": "Sisters Myriam and Romy are the founders of Maguire, an independent, direct-to-consumer fashion footwear company. With no connections in the fashion industry, Myriam and Romy’s entrepreneurial journey was propelled by sheer determination and grit. It all started with a desire to make high-quality shoes accessible for more people: “Everywhere we shopped, it was always a choice between quality or affordability,” the sisters recall. “I worked in fast fashion [as a designer for white-label brands],” says Myriam, President and Lead Designer. “I saw the way things were done: there are a lot of middle-men in the industry, driving up margins. I thought there could be a way to offer better products at better prices.” Myriam was always interested in footwear design, having obtained a Footwear Diploma at the prestigious Cordwainer’s College in London. Before founding Maguire, she would work at United Colours of Benetton in Treviso, Pajar and the Aldo Group in Montréal, and design for dozens of white-label clients including Opening Ceremony, Target, and Kohls. Romy, for her part, is no stranger to the world, having lived in Vancouver, Paris, and Sydney. A communications major with diverse interests, she worked with creative agencies and film festivals before joining her sister in the venture. As head of Operations and Marketing at Maguire, she brings a multidisciplinary approach and a fresh perspective to an age-old industry. The duo launched Maguire online in 2017 with a single product and $15k. Only five years later, Maguire has more than twenty employees and is incorporated in two countries with stores in Montréal, Toronto, and New York City. They have been featured in Forbes, WWD, Elle, and Bazaar, and won the Emerging Talent Award for Accessories at the Canadian Fashion Awards in 2022. Still proudly independent, Myriam and her sister Romy continue to grow their mission to bring transparency, quality and fair prices to women’s footwear.

    "aboutContent": "BROYA’S STORY STARTS WITH MINE. Growing up, I had some health issues that impacted my life, but never bad enough to search for a diagnoses. But by the time I was 20 years old, I had a laundry list of foods I could or could not eat based on how they made my gut feel.It was a miserable feeling, knowing that if I ate the wrong thing I’d feel bloated, lethargic, and could barely think straight.When I was 22, I started to connect the dots that my digestion sensitivities were due to an imbalance in my gut. That's when I took a deep dive into food and nutrition, doing everything I could to learn how to heal from the inside out. ALL SIGNS POINTED TO THE BENEFITS OF BONE BROTH. At this point, I was in touch with a local farmer and had purchased half of a grass-fed cow. I grabbed three coolers and drove two hours to pick it up, ready to pack my freezer with high quality cuts of meat.What I didn't know was that with half a cow comes around 100 lbs of bones; giving me the perfect opportunity to simmer my first batch of bone broth. Bone Broth Benefits Promotes Youthful Skin Aid Digestion & Supports Gut Health Supports a Good Nights Sleep Helps Reduce Cravings Supports A Healthy Immune System I WAS HOOKED. From that day forward, I’ve drank two cups of broth a day; once in the morning before my coffee and then in the afternoon to fend off the afternoon slump.Slowly, I noticed the difference in my gut, mood, and especially my energy. Every time I had a cup of broth, I felt like Super Mario after chowing down on a magical mushroom. I KNEW I HAD TO SHARE THIS FEELING WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. So in 2015, I started putting together the pieces of Broya - and choosing a supplier was my first big step. I knew I wanted to make an impact in thousands of lives, so I reached out to a few streamline suppliers who I thought could help me reach that goal.But the more I dug into the meat industry, the more I learned how disgusting industrial farms were and how detrimental choosing one would be for my customers and the earth. IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME CONSIDER GIVING UP MEAT AND MY MISSION ALL TOGETHER. But as I weighed my options, I decided what I had learned would not stop me from helping others. I knew there were responsible farmers out there who raised happy cattle and would jump at a chance to work with a company like Broya. SO, I EXPANDED MY MISSION BEYOND SHARING THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF BONE BROTH. The world deserves a better way to get vital nutrients and support small farmers instead of relying on Big Agriculture.That’s why we do things different at Broya.We’re hyper-intentional about each step of the supply chain process, from raw ingredients to finished product. All our products are made from grass-fed, happily raised animals from local farms as a base for bone broth--nothing but high-quality ingredients.Broya makes it easy to start supporting local farmers, happy animals, a thriving environment, and your health and wellbeing. All at the same time.",

    "aboutContent": "Our Aim Our aim is to provide the cleanest possible products for your body. This means 100% natural products, full of medicinal organics and completely free of cortisone, steroids, DEA (diethanolamine), sulfates, salt (sodium chloride), propylene glycol, aluminum, synthetic fragrances, and dyes. With a constantly increasing awareness of the potentially harmful chemical and synthetic ingredients used in health and beauty products, it is becoming more apparent that safer, naturally derived and organic alternatives should be made available. Many synthetic ingredients, such as those noted above, are potentially harmful chemicals used in most beauty related products available on the common market today. They are inexpensive and make the products appear richer in quality by providing either foam enhancing, thickening or moisture retaining properties to the product. These ingredients have undergone extensive testing and many are now recognized as potentially harmful to human health or the environment. They can be absorbed through the skin and into the blood stream and may eventually accumulate in various organs of the body. At Carina, we have chosen a healthier approach to manufacturing self-care products. Since Carina's inception in 1972, replacing chemical and synthetic ingredients with natural and organic plant extracts, essences, and oils has been central to our focus and philosophy. This simple formula has helped Carina and its products become recognized and preferred internationally. Certified organic, entirely natural and synthetic-free ingredients provide our shampoo products with mild, yet effective, cleansing properties and the foam produced is rich and creamy. This is due to the essential tree, herb, fruit and flower extracts that are added to complement our formulations. In our skin creams and conditioners, organic essences and oils from avocado, olive, flax seed, pumpkin seed and sunflower help the skin to naturally retain and maintain its moisture level and hydration so it does not dry out prematurely. We take great pride in using the highest quality ingredients possible in our formulations. A personal \"hands-on\" approach is taken when selecting and harvesting the proper tree essences, herbs, plants, fruits, flowers and vegetables.Throughout the year, ingredients such as alfalfa, chamomile, echinacea, nettle, red clover, along with a variety of botanical tree essences, are hand selected and harvested from different regions of the Pacific Northwest's forests and farms. With a distinct focus on holistic remedies, purity, craft, and quality, all Carina products are manufactured by hand on the North Shore of Vancouver, British Columbia.",

Our local quest for a refreshing ready-to-drink margarita and paloma was inspired by the desire for a tropical escape in the midst of a challenging season staying home. At the time, we struggled to find local options that tasted like the real deal without being full of sugar and artificial flavours. We knew then that the only way to satisfy our craving for a crisp and refreshing tequila cocktail was to craft one ourselves using premium ingredients! TURNS OUT, WE WEREN'T ALONE. Our journey to create something totally unique was also driven by other margarita and paloma lovers who were feeling the same way. By combining the vision of a premium cocktail brand with a year-long adventure of perfecting recipes, Olé Cocktails Co. was born! Perfectly balanced and crafted with care, our cocktails are made with premium quality blue weber agave tequila from Jalisco, México, real fruit juices, organic agave nectar, and a delectable pinch of sea salt. Irresistible taste with no artificial colours, flavours, or sweeteners. Just one sip will leave you with a crisp, clean finish and a light sparkle.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Our founder, author and activist, Barb Stegemann shares why sustainably sourced ingredients from nations rebuilding after war or strife is in the DNA of our brand from day one. \"My real job is to make rebuilding sexier than destruction.I do this through perfume.\" -Barb Stegemann Barb Stegemann, Founder and CEO This is our origin story - how we began When my best friend, a soldier serving in the military was wounded on his mission to liberate women and girls in Afghanistan, I took on his mission of peace while he healed. Sourcing legal orange blossom and rose essential oil crops freed Afghan farmers from the illegal poppy crop and liberated their daughters from becoming young opium brides. I’ve taken my philosophy of equality and empowerment around the world to Haiti, Rwanda, The Middle East, India, and Madagascar. Because it’s the right thing to do. This is our story today Today, we have evolved into an aromatherapy clean perfume brand that sources sustainable oils as well as upcycled oils. Our focus on truly ending war is by empowering girls and women by ending period poverty at home and around the world. We have partnered with Days for Girls and Charity Water. Share how The 7 Virtues social enterprise is a sustainable beauty brand? Empowering others is in the DNA of our brand, it’s the why behind why I set out on this journey to give dignity and jobs to others. We walk our talk. Every part of our journey is sustainable from our ingredients to our packaging. Our partner, CPL aromas are experts in sustainable, raw and natural ingredients and connect us with more suppliers to expand our reach worldwide. Did you know there is an award winning movie on The 7 Virtues story called Perfume War? Did you know our brand began as a best selling book written by our founder to empower women to launch companies, end bullying and run for office? The 7 Virtues began as a book. Barb promised her best friend, Captain Trevor Greene in the hospital she would take on his mission of peace while he healed. Then she realized as a woman in this patriarchy, she didn’t have a way, so she created a new way. The 7 Virtues of a Philosopher Queen – a woman’s guide to living & leading in an illogical world has empowered women to launch companies, end bullying and run for office. Harnessing women’s buying power and voting power to end corruption, poverty and war is Barb’s mission. Tell us about your secondary packaging and how it is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) approved. We are a family run social enterprise. My husband Mike who is our head of operations, also wrote a book on the environment with my best friend, Captain Greene titled, There’s no Planet B. The environment and the future of our children is crucial to us. That’s why all of our secondary packaging is FSC approved. This means the wood our paperboard and blotters are made from come from responsibly managed forests. Why is The 7 Virtues a compassionate company and share your list of credentials. I personally don’t eat meat and make my own vegan cheese. I feel everything we do on this planet should protect the earth and humans and animals alike. We are vegan and cruelty free accredited by PETA. In addition to PETA, we passed the rigorous audit of the holy grail of vegan accreditation, Leaping Bunny. As a Leaping Bunny certified beauty brand it means all of our suppliers passed their strict audits. Consumers need to look for the Leaping Bunny to know that the entire chain of ingredients passed the rigorous to know you truly have a 100 per cent cruelty free vegan brand. This to us is crucial as we don’t use any animal products (no musks or beeswax etc) nor are our perfumes tested on animals (Just on my hot husband). Our cat Waldo really appreciates this too. We don’t test on animals, we love our pet cat Waldo. We prefer to test on our friends and family.",

    "aboutContent": "SIMPLE SOLUTIONS TO ELEVATE YOUR HOMEThe Bare Home Started As A Passion Project.I remember becoming very conscious of sustainable living during my time in Germany. I loved the simple things people were doing in their daily lives to be more environmentally conscious and I quickly began to adopt this \"new\" way of life.After 7 years, my husband and I decided to move back to Canada with our young family. I knew life in Canada was going to be much different than what I had become accustom to in Europe, but I was feeling inspired and excited to bring some of that lifestyle home with me.I had caught the entrepreneurial bug around that time and was actively looking to start my own business. But it had to be something that I could truly feel passionate and good about... SHOP OUR COLLECTIONS THE BARE HOME IS BORN.At first, the Bare Home was more than cleaning products. I was offering a variety of fair trade foods and other zero waste products. However, I quickly noticed that customers were most interested in the refilling options for my laundry and cleaning products. So I began to pivot my focus towards cleaning products and even went as far as having customers leave their empty bottles on their doorstep and I was driving around refilling them!It was clear that people loved the idea that they could have one bottle and simply refill it. They wanted the convenience without the waste.They're looking for a better option and I was ready to come up with a solution. THE BARE HOME 2.0After months of design and development, I launched a full line of cleaning products along with a unique 3 liter and 10 liter at-home refill station and in-store refill station.When creating the collection, my two priorities were to create products that were effective and clean for the environment. This meant that all of the products would be biodegradable, phosphate free, and dye free. Never tested on animals and only scented with high quality essential oils. By using refillable products in your home, you're contributing to the elimination of single use plastics. Refilling with one three liter box replaces six bottles going to landfill.SMALL CHANGES MAKE BIG IMPACTS. Two line slide title.

    "aboutContent": "Made with pure cane sugar and featuring the most unique packaging in the beverage industry, Jones Soda is a one of a kind premium soda known for its bold, unique flavors, colors, and ever changing labels submitted by our consumers. Created in Vancouver, BC in 1995 from the vision of Jones Soda founder, Peter van Stolk, and photographer/designer Victor John Penner, Jones was launched with the idea of incorporating random photographs onto our bottles using shots taken by Penner. But when consumers began submitting their own photos, we quickly realized that user sourced participation made the brand even more special. Run with the little guy. OUR TEAM I grew up in the “Jones culture”, skateboarding, snowboarding, BMX, dirt bikes, anything with a board or wheels…(if you're not first, you're last)….so I am stoked to get to work with truly great people everyday that bring great flavor, color, and fun (and pure cane sugar) to the world. JerryChief Growth Officer I joined the Jones team in May 2020 with three decades of experience in the CPG industry. Most recently I was Director of Sales & Distribution at Tim’s Cascade Snacks. I have built my career on trust, commitment and a strong work ethic managing direct, distributor and broker sales teams. The Pacific Northwest is home, born and raised in the PNW I am a loyal fan of the Seahawks, Mariners, Rainiers, Sonics, Zags and COUGS. I also enjoy traveling with my family, visiting the many great PNW wineries and playing golf. #JONESSODA DanVice President of Sales As a longtime Jones super fan, I’m super excited to be a part of the team! I was brought on in April of 2021 to lead marketing for the Mary Jones brand and have been so impressed by the culture and drive from the Jones crew. Prior to joining, I worked in different cannabis company where we were one of the first multistate operators in the US to launch and expand brand nationally. I live in a cabin in the woods in Colorado and spend my time on snowboards and bikes and wandering through the forest with my wife and 2 pups. DavidVice President of Marketing - Mary Jones I am part of a hard working team. We do work. We do it for the feeling we obtain & because we’re in search of something. We want to relive some great moment we had in the past. Moreover, it’s also to create some other incredible moment like the last one but more intense. As long as we reach our limits... but who knows where those are? Our realm is when we are together against a new dare. It can be anywhere, on snowboards, at the ballpark, in water, in the air... or at the office doing work. ChrisDirector of Operations I joined the JONES team in March 2004. I have been in the beverage industry since 1995 spending a few years on the distributor side of the business then moved to the supplier side. Home base is West Des Moines, Iowa with my beautiful wife Krista and our adorable kids Maxwell and Olivia. I spend most of my work time traveling across the country visiting our great distributors and retailers. My free time is spent with my family, friends and anything outdoors. ChadDirector of Sales Originally born and raised in South Africa, I am ecstatic to be a member of the Jones team. When I’m not working, I am enjoying time with my family or snuggling dogs! I love nature, spontaneous adventures and travelling! DanielleDirector of Human Resources & Customer Service I can't wait to dive in here and get to work providing the technical support for Jones formulations, ingredients, co-manufacturers, and operations team! With a Master of Science and a MBA, I bring experience in Food Science, Quality, Regulatory and R&D. I previously worked for Boston Market, Tyson, SunFed Ranch/ Teton Waters Ranch and JM Smucker. I love being outside with my dog and two horses. You can find me playing soccer or field hockey or on a horse. I love my Denver sports teams, gardening, and cooking. KristinaDirector of Product Development & Commercialization I have been in the grocery business for 40 years, working for several Grocery and CPG companies. I started at Alpha Beta as a courtesy clerk. I've been a Broker, Buyer and Key Account Manager and have seen the Grocery business grow and shrink though the years. I'm very proud of my family and the rich history that they have in the Grocery-CPG industry. My mother was the first female inducted into the Grocery Hall of Fame in Northern California. I've been married for 39 years to the same great lady (Tish) who puts up with my jokes and silly antics; like wearing silly hats and costumes. I have three great kids (2 boys and 1 girl) and have the great honor of being a grandfather to seven grandkids (4 girls and 3 boys); and we can’t forget the 2 cats.

    "aboutContent": "Raven was sent by the creator of the universe, to redesign the earth after the first great ice age of cleansing. After Mother Earth added the foliage, Raven made all the new animals big and small. Then lastly, he made a Spirit Bear — a symbolic gift of peace and harmony to all creatures of the earth.Inspired by this story, Spirit Bear Coffee Company was born. Today, products from this quality coffee operation can be found in over 600 locations countrywide. The company, clearly having fun with their brand, sells the likes of “Raven\" espresso beans (full of life and strength), “Eagle” medium roast (soaring flavour) and “Frog-Breakfast Blend” light roast (jump start your day).“We’re certified organic and fair trade,” says Paul Biglin, co-president alongside Sean Harding. “Ten years ago, we were told we would never survive. We fight the big guys all the time. The Tim Hortons and the Starbucks of the world. It’s tough to be an Aboriginal company in a commodity driven market. Tough to get people believing in you. But once they do, they’re fiercely loyal. Now, we have over 50 resorts countrywide on our books.”Biglin says he gets to travel from coast to coast to meet with different communities. “I meet Cree, Blackfoot, Mohawk people. What I’m learning is amazing. If you’re open minded enough to experience what’s out there, you’ll find we live in an amazing country. We’re always trying to expand our market place and work with other nations. Our goal is to work with every nation in North America.\"",

    "aboutContent": "About Warren Steven Scott is a contemporary accessory designer, fashion designer, and craftsperson. His label was formed in 2018. Born in 1988 in White Rock, B.C., Scott is a member of the Nlaka’pamux Nation, whose territory is located in the interior of present-day British Columbia, with Sts’ailes and British ancestry. Growing up, Scott immersed himself in North American and European fashion culture, obsessively flipping through magazines and watching the iconic Canadian television series, Fashion File. The designers he looked up to created garments that were fantastical and other-worldly, offering a window through which he could envision an alternative, seemingly unattainable way of life. Following a brief period of enrollment at a local college for horticultural studies, and realizing his love for fashion, Scott left school with a curious, open mind and devised a plan to pursue his dream of designing clothes. It wasn’t until he began assembling his first portfolio application that Scott taught himself to sew. In 2011 he attended Ryerson University, where he would later receive a Bachelor of Design in Fashion. He received an educational sponsorship from his Band and is a two-time bursary recipient of Indspire. After graduating from Ryerson, Scott interned for esteemed Canadian designers Jeremy Laing and Comrags, where he credits receiving his formal training. Scott’s debut collection, Sissy, took place as part of the inaugural Indigenous Fashion Arts Festival in Toronto, founded by Indigenous artist and innovator, Sage Paul. His collection bridges the Western concept of luxury fashion with his ancestral worldview on ethics, craft, and aesthetic sensibility, representing a distinct contribution to a genuine Canadian fashion. Scott’s approach to design pictures a modern image of fashion through an Indigenous lens. The Sissy woman is cute, fluid, and enviable, representing a vision of girlishness and familial sisterhood. Scott lives and works in Toronto.",

Alice + Sage is best known for hand-poured coconut and soy wax candles that support wellness, gathering, and joy. It's our mission to kindly craft items that light up your life, inspire a connection & are safe for you, your family, your pets, and the environment. Meet Salina: Boozhoo! Hello! I am Salina - owner and maker at Alice + Sage. I am Anishinaabe (bear clan) and Ukrainian, and a member of Lake St. Martin First Nation. Growing up on Treaty 2 Territory in St. Martin, Manitoba and spending so much time outdoors, I've always had a deep love and connection with nature, animals, and spirit. Ever since I was a little girl I was drawn to the mountains and ocean. I moved to Vancouver, BC in 2010 and then to Abbotsford in the Fraser Valley in 2021 before finally making my way home to Manitoba in 2024. I spent the majority of those years working in mental health and addiction - supporting folks in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. That's also when I really began my own journey of healing and learning how to connect to my spirit, and how essential self-care/love is to our entire well-being. One of the questions I'm always asked is, “Why did you start making candles?” Like so many of my ideas - it came to me in a dream. First I had a dream of making candles, and then I had another dream of making specifically soy candles and calling my business Alice + Sage. My grandmother on my dad's side was named Alice, and she is who all of my aunties say I get my dimples from. I also have a cat named Sir Alice. He’s the big cutie you see from time to time who likes to supervise me while I make my candle creations. Everything about ALICE really just represents love - one of our sacred teachings. As for SAGE... it represents wisdom; another one of our Seven Sacred Teachings. It’s about taking time. Slowing down. Practicing patience. Being intentional. Understanding. Giving thanks. Showing respect. Honouring every part of the process. It’s always been my personal mission to connect with people, animals, and the earth in a good way. Being able to create wellness products that light up your life and support your own healing and wellness journey is truly a dream come true! Endless thanks & appreciation. Chi Miigwech! Salina xo",

    "aboutContent": "Our SToryWelcome to Mother Earth Essentials, founded by Carrie Armstrong, a Cree woman born and raised in Hinton, Alberta. She is a Registered Treaty Status card holder, connected to the disenfranchised Michel First Nation. Rooted in the Belcourt and Calliou families, Carrie’s passion for the healing power of plants was inspired by her grandmother.With experience as an esthetician, cosmetic sales representative, and educator at Amiskwaciy Academy, Carrie created Mother Earth Essentials to celebrate the beauty and benefits of Canadian plants. In 2020, she published \"Mother Earth Plants for Health & Beauty: Indigenous Plants, Traditions and Recipes,\" showcasing Indigenous knowledge and traditional uses of wild plants.Carrie collaborates with her Elders and knowledge keepers to preserve Indigenous plant wisdom at the heart of our business. As a registered Treaty Status member, she proudly upholds her cultural heritage. Our business is registered with the CCIB, which requires verified proof of Indigenous status, ensuring that we authentically represent our community.Thank you for supporting our journey. We invite you to explore our products and celebrate the rich heritage of Indigenous plants with us. Honouring Heritage and TraditionAt Mother Earth Essentials, we are deeply rooted in the traditions and wisdom passed down through generations. Our founder, Carrie Armstrong, was inspired by her grandmother, mother and aunts’ teachings of healing plants and natural remedies, which were kept hidden out of fear but shared in moments of solitude. It was through these teachings that Carrie discovered the power of cultural wisdom to heal not only individuals but communities as well.Carrie’s grandmother had experienced great loss and trauma as a result of the residential school system, leading her to hide her cultural knowledge to protect her family. The generational shame and disconnect from their Indigenous heritage weighed heavily on the family members, including Carrie, who initially believed it best to shield her own children from their cultural background.However, a pivotal teaching job at an Indigenous high school in Edmonton opened Carrie’s eyes to her past and cultural identity. It was there that she saw the power of cultural teachings in revitalizing communities and recognized the importance of preserving and celebrating Indigenous traditions. Drawing from her previous experience in cosmetics and a deep desire to showcase the beauty and contributions of her culture, Mother Earth Essentials was born. Reclaiming Cultural IdentityThe history of residential schools in Canada has had a lasting impact on Indigenous communities, creating a legacy of trauma that has been passed down through generations. More than 150,000 First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children were forced to attend these schools, where they were stripped of their language, culture, and connection to their families. The lasting effects of this experience have created barriers to cultural revitalization and reconciliation.Carrie’s journey of rediscovery and connection to her heritage led her to recognize the importance of reclaiming Indigenous identity and celebrating cultural traditions. Through Mother Earth Essentials, she aims to empower individuals to reconnect with their roots, reclaim the wisdom of their ancestors, and embrace the beauty of Indigenous culture. Carrie hopes to help others heal and find pride in their heritage by honouring the teachings of her mother, aunts, grandmother and other Indigenous elders. Healing Through ConnectionMother Earth Essentials is not just a company; it's a movement dedicated to cultural preservation and empowerment.

Satya was first started out of my small, $15 crockpot — not because I had big business dreams or a desire to be an entrepreneur, but because of a real need.My baby girl, Esme, was scratching her arms and legs bloody. The doctor diagnosed her with eczema and prescribed a topical steroid. Overwhelmed by the scientific-based evidence of the side effects of steroid creams, I knew there had to be a better solution.I wanted something effective, non-toxic, and fragrance-free, backed by scientifically supported research. But to my disappointment, I couldn't find a single product that could safely heal her skin. Seeing my daughter in pain was the absolute worst feeling in the world. I decided to take matters into my own hands.For nights, I used my investigative skills as a journalist and dug into traditional medicine, medical research, and the latest academic studies coming out of universities, desperate to find a solution. I began experimenting in my kitchen with nothing more than a crockpot and the best organic ingredients I could find.Voila! There it was. I created a balm that would clear Esme's eczema up within two days. JUST LIKE THAT, MY SECOND BABY, SATYA ORGANIC, WAS BORN! I never intended to become a business owner, but after having so many moms drive hours to try my formula, I knew this was my way of creating change. As a mom, I knew that I couldn't be the only one struggling to find clean and effective skincare for my family that actually does what it says it does.I want every parent, partner, or friend to be able to access safe skin relief for their loved ones. I want every eczema warrior in the world to get back to doing what they love most without the feeling of discomfort in their skin, or the painful, long-term effects of steroid creams. I created Satya for Esme because I only wanted the very best for my own baby, and I believe you deserve that trust and confidence in your skincare too.Because of you, we get to keep doing what we are so incredibly passionate about — delivering clean, effective, and steroid-free skin relief to those who need it most.Thank you for supporting our big mission here at Satya!

    "aboutContent": "+ABOUT △ ABOUT INNER WOLF JEWELRY △ Inner Wolf Jewelry is owned and operated independently by Ashya Elizabeth. Creating from her studio in so-called Vancouver, Ashya’s work is influenced by her Cree and Turkish ancestry, every piece infused with elemental components of the natural and spiritual world. Ashya has allowed her ancestral lines to remain one of the greatest influences in the art she creates. Holding onto a deep connection with the earth, animals and minerals, Ashya incorporates this in her work through primarily using raw stones as well as hair, quills and feathers. Whether using antler sheds or feathers sourced from elders, every gift from the animals is humanely sourced, honored and respected. Growing up with an influential, intelligent and culturally connected mother, Ashya was immersed in ancestral knowledge, cultural history and an informed perspective on historical and contemporary Indigenous issues. Guided by her aunties and other family members, Ashya made her first dreamcatcher at the age of eight. This passion for creating has been instilled in her from a young age, passed down through familial relationships and braided into her work today. Ashya studied at the University of Saskatchewan, exploring lithography, printmaking, painting and art history. This education provided a structured foundation for her to work from, eventually evolving into the practice of jewelry making. Acting as a conduit, Ashya draws on ancestral and cultural teachings to create pieces that tell a story. As she evolves in learning new techniques, she always returns to a place of gratitude for the support she receives. Her business is based on the primary values of honesty, authenticity and affordability. Ashya believes that being adorned and made to feel beautiful should be accessible, regardless of your budget. Her materials are ethically sourced and she is proud to be able to share these pieces of her culture with the world. You can find Ashya’s work in a number of small shops across the country, in local markets and through her online shop. She loves being able to meet her customers face-to-face and connect with you in person! All my work feels worth it when I see that customers feel they have something special and are proud to be wearing one of my creations. Thank you to every single person who has purchased a piece from me along the way - your support is very appreciated!

Forever struck by the resilience of people with disabilities and the barriers they face, it was Holly's goal to raise $500 in Milk Jar’s first year for programs that support learning and growth.

    "aboutContent": "About The BrandAt ANS Performance, we’re all about helping you push limits, break barriers, and reach new levels of performance—without the hype, just results. Proudly Canadian, we’ve been fueling athletes, gym-goers, and everyday warriors with top-quality nutrition since 2012. From powerful pre-workouts and clean protein formulas to innovative health and wellness supplements, everything we create is backed by science and designed to help you perform at your best. Whether you're chasing PRs, leveling up your fitness, or just looking to feel great, we’ve got your back. Our Story ANS Performance started as a passion project between two lifelong athletes who wanted to shake up the supplement industry—blending real science with real performance to create something different. Nick and Shetal first crossed paths back in 2006 while working in the pharmaceutical industry. Shetal, a chemical engineer, and Nick, a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry, ran the R&D lab for the Canadian division of a multi-billion-dollar global pharma company. Nick eventually dove into the world of sports nutrition, spending five years consulting for some of the biggest supplement brands and helping launch hundreds of products worldwide. But he knew there was still something missing—a brand that put science and quality first. In 2012, Nick and Shetal teamed up again to bring that vision to life. ANS Performance was born. The name stands for Advanced Nutraceutical Sciences, and that’s exactly what they set out to deliver—clean, high-performance supplements with no gimmicks, just results. Product Quality that is Second to None! At ANS Performance, we’re all about quality, innovation, and results. We carefully select every ingredient and work closely with all our suppliers to ensure they meet the highest standards—so you can perform at your best, no matter your goal. All our products are made in cGMP-certified facilities, approved by Health Canada and/or the US FDA, guaranteeing top-tier safety and quality. Plus, every batch goes through rigorous third-party testing to ensure purity, potency, and that unbeatable taste you expect. We’re not just a supplement company—we’re athletes and science-driven professionals who create the products we actually use ourselves and share with our families. Because when it comes to performance, we don’t cut corners.",

Then we make delicious & healthy products like cold-pressed juices and more. Even our leftover pulp gets repurposed! Our Story This whole grand adventure began on a Ferris wheel where our first \"date\" took place. We stayed there for hours, talking and envisioning a better world. We barely knew each other, but after that brief moment, we knew that with our shared passion for food and the environment, we had to start a project together. A project that would make a positive impact on the world.At the same time, we received a call from Fred at Courchesne Larose, the largest fruit and vegetable distributor in Canada. He was looking for a solution for the 16 to 20 tons of food they were losing every day. After visiting their warehouse and quickly discovering why these perfectly good fruits and vegetables were ending up in a landfill, the three of us promised to immediately get to work and find a solution. The stars were aligned, and the dream team was born.To tackle such a global challenge, we had no choice but to set our goals high. From day one, the vision was clear: to become the global leader in the circular economy within the food industry and to inspire new business practices by placing our mission, commitment, and our values at the heart of all our decisions. It is this vision that still motivates us every day, and we won't stop until food waste is eradicated from the face of the earth. That's our promise.Thank you for being here with us, and thank you for participating in our mission—you all contribute to something grand, and we will be eternally grateful to you.David, Julie & Fred — LOOP Mission Founders OUR RESCUE MISSION Nobody likes to be rejected, not even food. We came to the rescue and saw an opportunity to better the food industry by valorizing foods that would have been discarded for aesthetic reasons or shelf-life concerns. Although we’re famous for our cold-pressed juices made from perfectly imperfect fruits and veggies, we also craft beers made from day-old bread, gin that repurposes potato scraps from the Yum Yum chip factory, and soaps that recycle cooking oils from a restaurant chain. To close the LOOP, we use our own nutritious, high-fiber pulp and grains and transform them into energy bites!And we’re just getting started.

But at the time we couldn’t find a food that prioritized animal welfare, sustainability and transparency standards. We wanted to provide our own pets with premium nutrition that came from ingredients that were grown and raised the right way. We realized that a pet food with these standards didn’t exist, and saw an opportunity to create it ourselves. For us that meant sourcing the highest quality ingredients, supporting farmers who treat their animals right, respecting the environment, and providing full transparency to our customers. It’s out of that vision that Open Farm was born – from the simple idea that pet food can be good for your pet and Do Some Good, all at the same time.

But once I saw how broken the skincare industry really was, I couldn’t walk away. I had to fix it. I had to build something women could trust completely.Everything we do still comes from that place—protecting what matters most. And I’m so honoured you’re here.Each formula we create is designed with the same level of care I give my own family. If it’s not safe for me and my kids, it doesn’t make it into our line. I built this brand because I couldn’t find anything that met my standards—and now, I make sure you don’t have to compromise either. The migraineswere unbearable.For years, Michelle suffered without knowing why. The pain disrupted her life—but it wasn’t until her first pregnancy in 2008 that she started asking deeper questions.What was she eating? What was she using on her skin? On her family?She learned the truth the hard way: her body was reacting to toxins hidden in everyday products.Gluten was one of her biggest problems—but it wasn’t the only one.That discovery set off a chain reaction. She changed everything her family put in and on their bodies. What Other Skincare Brands Don't Want You To KnowMichelle immersed herself in the science of clean living and healthy skin.However, what she discovered within the skincare industry was even more disturbing than she had expected.Behind the beautiful packaging and trendy “natural” claims were:Harmful synthetics and irritating fragrances Formulas linked to hormone disruption, fertility issues, and even cancer Brands that told partial truths to create a false sense of safetyShe realized that most skincare brands were not built by people who truly understood the ingredients. They were built by people who outsourced everything, then wrapped it in a good story.This wasn’t just misleading. It was unethical. And she wasn’t going to be a part of it.So She Did Something No One Else WouldMichelle didn’t hire a lab. She became the lab.To ensure the very best, with no compromise, every product was researched, formulated, and tested by her personally.What began as a mother protecting her family grew into a product line trusted by thousands.From farmers markets to global customersOver 1,000,000 products have now been sold—but the core promise has never changed:✓ Every formula is developed in-house (not outsourced to a lab) ✓ No compromises on ingredients Simple Ingredients, Serious PowerBeauty From Bees' ingredient lists are usually under 10!While others chase complexity and cost savings, Michelle chased purity.Each ingredient is handpicked and purposeful—every single one is a hero. They never show you a few heroes and hide the rest, like most brands.You won’t find synthetics or fillers.No hidden preservatives.No “natural-ish” compromises.Just what the skin truly needs—nothing more, nothing less. And because her team found a preservation system that promotes health within the skin, even the integrity of the formula works in alignment with your body—not against it.The result is trust you can feel.Beauty From Bees isn’t just skincare—it’s a new standard. Built from the ground up by a mother who refused to cut corners.It’s why customers stay.It’s why they share their stories.It’s why they come back—again and again.They’re not just buying products.They’re buying peace of mind.They’re buying truth and beauty.Shop Best SellersHundreds of Thousands Happy Customers.Here are just a few inspiring storiesNatural.

Odd Bunch was created to overcome these critical issues — making fresh produce accessible to families & individuals, while tackling food waste head-on.Founded in 2017 in London, Ontario, Odd Bunch is proudly Canadian. Our mission is simple: reduce food waste and ensure fruits & vegetables are affordable for households across the country. Approximately 50% of all food produced in Canada is wasted. Grocery stores have strict cosmetic standards and anything that looks or feels a little different is rejected or dumped. Too Big? Too Small? Asymmetrical? No problem!We work with farms, greenhouses, and distributors to rescue this surplus and “odd” produce—fruits & vegetables that are just as fresh and high quality, but don’t meet arbitrary cosmetic standards.But we don’t stop there. To keep prices low and pass even more savings on to you, we strategically source our produce, working with Canadian farmers as much as possible year round and offsetting high import tariffs by recovering food that would otherwise be wasted. This means you get top-quality produce at up to 50% less than grocery store prices—all while supporting local agriculture and reducing food waste.Why Choose Odd Bunch?Save Money While Reducing Waste – Get fresh, locally sourced produce for a fraction of grocery store prices.Sourced Smarter, Priced Fairer – We partner with Canadian farms first, but when certain fruits & vegetables aren’t grown locally, we rescue surplus imports, ensuring quality without the high cost.Convenient Weekly Deliveries – Skip the grocery store with a flexible subscription that brings a curated selection of fresh fruits & vegetables straight to your doorstep.Support a Canadian Business That Cares – Every Odd Bunch box helps rescue surplus food, supports local farmers, and lowers the carbon footprint generated by food waste.We’re not just fighting food waste—we’re making fresh fruits & vegetables accessible to more Canadians.

    "aboutContent": "Our Origin Story The fluorescent boardroom lights buzzed overhead while we argued - again - about how to make tea cheaper. Add artificial flavouring and sweeteners to mask the bland flavour. Use smaller tea particles.“The focus group report is back - they don’t notice the difference.” But I did. As an executive at one of Canada’s largest coffee and tea brands, I watched something sacred turn synthetic, one quarter at a time. The so-called 'wellness' blends on shelves were months old - lifeless dust trapped in plastic sachets that leached microplastics and bleach into every 'healthy' cup.That winter, sick with the flu and craving my mother’s herbal remedy from India, I desperately tried every box on the grocery store shelf. Not one helped.Wrapped in a blanket, throat burning, eyes tearing up, I whispered - “Enough.”So I quit answering my Zoom calls and started blending with my hands.Turmeric stained my countertops gold.Steam fogged the windows.The entire house smelled like cardamom, chamomile, and stubborn hope.Three years. 170 blends.Red-eyed nights studying Ayurveda and traditional medicine until dawn.When friends began begging for refills - calling our teas 'magic' - I knew we’d found it.That’s how EQ State began: not to sell tea, but to restore its soul. Follow along as we build our business",

    "aboutContent": "As a Canadian-owned and operated family business, The Great Canadian Sox Company knows the value of products made in Canada. Established in 1934, the company’s proud sock history started in the Canadian logging industry and carries on that tradition with J.B. Fields, its outdoor adventure brand which specializes in technical socks for hiking, work wear, and extremely cold weather. In 1988, Sunil Khimasia, and his brother, Bipin, bought The Great Canadian Sox Company, putting their strong textile business background to work. Sunil’s son, Sid, who had spent many summer breaks on the factory floor joined the family business full-time in 2008. Seeing the economic shift toward online sales, Sid led the company to open e-commerce stores on Amazon, eBay, and eventually greatsox.com. His sister, Priyanka, joined the company in 2015 and opened the first retail store in Danforth, Toronto, soon followed by two more Toronto locations, as well as a Cambridge location. The company, which originally focused on customer sport and pattern dress and casual socks, now offers a greatly expanded line boasting its traditional premium quality products with a guaranteed comfortable fit. Today, The Great Canadian Sox Company manufactures both custom private label as well as their house brands – J.B. Field’s and Vagden. The company, as a family business, is passionate about promoting outdoor lifestyles through walking, hiking, biking, running, mountaineering, and skiing/snowboarding. They know that cold weather and poor quality socks should never stop customers from leading healthy lifestyles or enjoying the great outdoors. To ensure customers’ feet stay comfortable in the harshest conditions, The Great Canadian Sox Company uses only the highest quality materials manufactured with cutting edge technical features like reinforced heels and toes, arch and ankle support, as well as double cuff and ribbing. With the mission to get people outside to enjoy nature, The Great Canadian Sox Company has partnered with The Trans Canada Trail to craft branded merino wool hiking socks to keep trail users' feet happy while exploring the great outdoors. As a family company, the community is important to the Khimasia family, which regularly sponsors sock drives and donates socks to those in need.",

Awasis means \"child\" in Cree. While taking time off from teaching to be a stay at home Mama, Christine put her teaching areas Home Economics + Native Studies to use in a different capacity. What started off as sewing a few bibs + aprons for other Mamas due to exposure on social media, Christine quickly received continual orders and interest that led her to do some research on what was on the market for an Indigenous inspired baby/kids fashion line. To her surprise, there was no such thing in Canada. 4 months later, Awasis Boutique was born in Feb 2018 as an online shop. Featuring custom aprons, bibs, blankets, onesies, toddler tees + more. Within the first few months of launch date, retailers from both Saskatchewan and Alberta came across the products on social media which then led to several retail partnerships. Including Wanuskewin Heritage Park, USASK shop, Ready Set Baby + more.

    "aboutContent": "Meet the Founder Sequoia is a Proudly Indigenous brand that is 100% owned and operated by Indigenous women. Founded in 2002 by Michaelee Lazore who is Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) from Akwesáhsne and Northern Paiute from Nevada. The design, production, and packaging of all the products is done in the working studio locally. In order to keep the next seven generations in mind, the production is sustainable and ingredients are ethically sourced.Sequoia has come a long way from its humble beginnings in Michaelee's kitchen. When Michaelee first started out, she was also working as an engineer designing roads, sewers and ditches. Her passion for creating beautiful soaps drove her to quit her day job as an engineer. Now Sequoia serves customers all over the world with their Indigenous inspired products. A note from Michaelee When choosing a name for my company, I fell in love with the name Sequoia. To me, it not only represented nature, but also strength. The giant Sequoia trees can live 2,000 to 3,000 years. The name also has a native connection as well. It's the name of the Cherokee chief who developed their alphabet so that the language could be written. A technical minded person just like me!One of the main reasons I started Sequoia was because I couldn't find any products that were not only made locally, but made by an Indigenous company. Scents such as Sweetgrass, Cedar, Sage were not commonplace back then, and those were some of my favorites I could not find anywhere. My Inspiration I have been inspired my entire life by my grandmother, who made cradleboards, beadwork, and hide work all her life. I would not be running my own creative business if it were not for her. She empowered and showed me that I am capable of creating and making beautiful things. I know 2020 has been a pretty rough year for everyone, especially for me, as I lost my grandmother at the beginning of the year. She would always encouraged me and I know I made her proud.We hope you enjoy our products as much as I enjoy offering them to you.

    "aboutContent": "THE PURPOSE With bold and artistic apparel, we amplify underrepresented voices, raise awareness, spark conversations, echo important narratives, and inspire transformative change. THE BRAND Resist Clothing Company, an Indigenous-owned streetwear label; headquartered in Sagamok First Nation; with our distribution warehouse in Tkaronto (Toronto/Treaty 13 Territory). This setup keeps us connected to our roots while efficiently serving customers nationwide and abroad. THE HISTORY Founded in 2020 by Mitch Gegwetch; Ojibwe and a member of Sagamok First Nation. This journey began with a DIY printed t-shirt adorned with the phrase 'F*CK Colonialism' and worn at local events in Toronto Ontario. This provocative design turned heads and started conversations about resilience, culture and being unapologetically Indigenous. This highlighted a gap in the market of bold Indigenous streetwear. Resist Clothing Company was born on May 31st 2020 and the rest is history. Frequently Asked Questions related to our brand Do you have a store location I can visit? No, and here is why: Our strategic approach to being an online-only brand, allows us to focus on offering competitive pricing and a diverse range of products, without the overhead costs associated with brick and mortar storefronts (Leasing, Insurance, Extra Employee's, Logistics, etc). While we do not plan to open a flagship store, we actively connect with our customers through occasional pop-ups, events and partnerships with retailers across Canada and the USA.In addition to our online store, our products are also available in various retail shops, gift shops, and convenience stores, including some within Indigenous communities. This network of partnerships provides ample opportunities for customers to access our brand throughout Turtle Island (North America).Please note that our shared warehouse space is not open to the public for pick-ups. Does your brand attend fashion shows, award ceremonies, or similar events? We choose not to participate in fashion shows, award ceremonies, or other performative events. While we respect and admire those who find value in these opportunities, our approach as an Indigenous-owned brand is a little different. Our focus is on staying true to our purpose, identity, and the quality of our work. We aim to create meaningful, impactful products that spark conversations and resonate deeply with our audience, wherever they may be. For us, success isn’t defined by awards or accolades but by the genuine connections and impact our designs inspire. How do your products reflect your values? We honor our roots through thoughtful design and a commitment to quality. Our products carry stories that matter—not only because they’re loud, but because they’re real. This is our way of contributing to the narrative of Indigenous resilience and creativity without compromising our values. Why should I support your brand? By supporting us, you’re standing with a brand that refuses to follow the conventional, 'profit above all else' path of capitalism. We reject the idea that growth means we have to strive to be the biggest brand in the room. For us, growth is about staying grounded in what matters most: creating meaningful, impactful products while honoring our culture and values. We do things differently—authentically, intentionally, and with integrity. Thank you for choosing to stand alongside a brand that isn’t afraid to go against the grain. Why does your brand post so rarely on social media? We prefer quality over quantity. In a world filled with constant noise and competition for your attention, we choose to stand apart by sharing meaningful, intentional posts rather than simply adding to the clutter. We post about our products from time to time, or to celebrate significant events, dates or features among the topic of resilience and Indigenous resistance. Why doesn’t your brand follow trends like many other Indigenous businesses? While we don’t center our business around following trends, we occasionally create designs that align with them when they resonate with our vision and audience. However, our focus remains on authenticity and intentionality, ensuring our work stays meaningful and impactful rather than trend-driven. For us, trends are a tool—not the foundation of our brand. © 2025 Resist Clothing Company Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "aboutContent": "About Us Our Story Waxetty was born in Vegreville, Alberta—right around the time our home smelled amazing but the excitement of making it smell amazing had totally worn off. After years of tossing the same wax melts into the cart (usually between dog treats and toothpaste), it all started to feel like just another chore. We missed the thrill. So, we created it.Waxetty brings back the joy of scent—fun, fresh, and anything but routine. What is Waxetty? We specialize in handcrafted wax melts made from our own premium blend of coconut, soy, and beeswax. Every scent is carefully curated using phthalate-free and paraben-free fragrances—because you deserve the good stuff. Our melts are long-lasting, easy to use, and don’t leave behind any soot or mess. Just beautiful, clean fragrance that makes you stop and go “ahhhh…” Why We Started After countless compliments from guests saying “your house smells so pretty,” we figured it was time to stop gatekeeping and start sharing. So we rolled up our sleeves (and probably had a wax spill or two) and got to work. Waxetty was our way of turning a simple habit into something we actually look forward to. More Than Just Wax Waxetty isn’t just a shopping cart—it’s a scent journey. We make it easy to fall in love with your all-time faves while still leaving room for surprise hits you never saw coming. Plus, we’ve got accessories like wax liners and warmer dishes to make melting simple, clean, and kind of addictive. Built by Family (and Supervised by Dogs) We’re a family-run business with a love for pets and playful scents. Our pups are always nearby—often “helping” by checking out the coconut waxes! Every product we make is pet-conscious, scent-sensitive, and tested in our own home before it ever reaches yours. When you support Waxetty, you’re supporting a real family (with real dogs) doing what we love. What We Value Curiosity, creativity, and a nose for adventure Quality ingredients and handcrafted care Kindness to people, pets, and the planet Making scent fun again—not just another checkbox on your to-do list Our Vision To make your home smell amazing in a way that’s anything but boring. We’re here to help you rediscover the joy in scent—one wax bar at a time. Happy Melting Whether you're new here or a longtime fan, we’re so glad you stopped by.Light that warmer, drop in a Waxetty melt, and let the magic begin. From our family to yours—happy melting!The Waxetty Team - aka Julie, Greg, and Family!",

    "aboutContent": "When years of hustling in tech startups wreaked havoc on Sam's health, the Quebec City entrepreneur went looking for answers. His curiosity led him to a holistic health coach named Christophe Contant who prescribed him a daily regimen of movement, nature, and whole foods. It worked. One recipe in particular–a turbocharged twist on Bircher muesli that soaks overnight to be eaten in the morning–changed his life, restoring his energy levels and helping to heal his gut. They knew they had something big. Over the next two years, Sam, Chris, and an angel investor-turned-CEO named Charles Sansregret developed and perfected the product of their dreams: a magic muesli nutritious enough to help you go the distance, whether you're in the last stretch of an marathon or on your third all-nighter with a newborn. They called it HOLOS, derived from the Ancient Greek word holo ὅλος, meaning \"whole,” because of everything it is and aspires to be: the breakfast of champions and casual joggers, a real-food revolution in a reusable jar. As a kid growing up in Quebec City, a French-speaking city with cobblestone streets and old European charm, Sam always dreamed of starting his own company like his childhood idol Richard Branson. By 23, he’d actually done it. After dropping out of college and hustling in the music business–working for management companies and a live-streaming startup–he moved to Toronto and co-founded an app that let fans record themselves lip-syncing to songs as a way to create crowd-sourced music videos. The app, called JamCam, experienced some early success, partnering with PSY (of “Gangnam Style” fame) and launching Maroon 5’s single “Sugar.” But in the end, they struggled to gain traction and stay independent, ultimately losing out to their primary competitor, a Chinese app now known as TikTok. The stress of working in startups had taken its toll, and in early 2015, Sam returned to Quebec physically and emotionally depleted. Making matters worse, his on-the-go lifestyle–long flights, cheap meals, and living paycheck to paycheck–had wreaked havoc on his health, leaving him chronically bloated and burned out. He was determined to hit the reset button, but resolving his health issues was harder than he anticipated. “Everything I tried felt insufficient,” Sam says. “I met with doctors. I took supplements and drank protein shakes. But nothing helped the bloating. My energy was still zapped. It was maddening.”Eventually, one of Sam’s best friends connected him with Chris Contant, a holistic health nut and yoga teacher who had recently moved back from British Columbia where he studied at the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition. An avid surfer, free-skier, and hardcore outdoorsman obsessed with natural foods, he’s “part caveman, part guru, part spiritual guide,” says Sam, and has a pantry stocked with supplements, superfoods, and chaga mushrooms that he harvested in the forest. He drafted Sam an alternative health plan, one without medications or trendy shortcuts. Instead, it focused on a mix of daily movement (yoga, meditation, martial arts) and a diet rich in real, organic food. Chris’ approach centered on the slow-burning power of complex carbohydrates, which were delivered through a custom concoction of grains, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, spices, superfoods and probiotics that soaked overnight to be consumed in the morning. A modern twist on Bircher Müesli, the popular European breakfast invented by pioneering Swiss physician Dr. Maximilian Bircher-Brenner in the early 1900s, it was loaded with plant proteins, fiber, vitamins and minerals yet tasted like an elevated oatmeal. Dr. Birch-Brenner understood the medicinal power of muesli: In the early 1900s, he prescribed the blend at his famous holistic health clinics where he treated patients with diet, exercise, and natural sunlight instead of traditional medicine. A century later in Quebec City, Chris had been workshoping his own spin on the recipe, calling it his “magic formula” for yoga and endurance training. Most importantly, for Sam, it worked. “I healed completely in a couple of months,” he says. “And I loved everything about the magic muesli. I felt light and supercharged. My entrepreneurial wheels started turning.” Sam asked Chris to make him 10 ziploc bags of the blend. A few weeks later, they set up a makeshift factory in Sam’s mom’s basement where they packaged the muesli in dollar-store jars to sell to family and friends. That summer, they isolated themselves in a cottage in Mont Sainte-Anne to build the company of their dreams. By living their target consumers’ core values–early morning sunlight, HOLOS for breakfast, raw fruits and vegetables, and long walks across the mountain's slopes and summits to harness thehealing power of nature–they fine-tuned their vision for a brand that connected nutrition with nature. Once the product was absolutely perfect–nutty, grainy, and not too powdery, with a nutrient level superior to everything on the market–they called it HOLOS, a derivation of the Ancient Greek word “holo” (ὅλος), meaning “whole,” as a way to honor the balance and spirit necessary for a long and healthy life. “In the end, it’s about more than diet and exercise,” Chris says. “Holistic health is about everything–fresh air, good company, a clear mind, deep sleep, and remembering to have fun.” Over the next three years, Sam and Chris gave HOLOS everything they had–sweat, tears, and their entire savings. By the winter of 2018, they'd raised enough funds to open their first mini-factory where they fulfilled 400 orders by hand. As word spread, they caught the attention of Charles Sansregret–an angel investor and marketing expert with a deep passion for the outdoors and endurance sports–who proved to be the final piece of the puzzle. \"I wanted to help build a brand that represented my lifestyle–active, busy, healthy,” Charles says. “And it had to be a tangible, physical product. HOLOS ticked every box.” It helped that Charles ran in a circle of serious outdoors enthusiasts. His long-term partner Elisabeth Cauchon and her brother, Jeff, are two of the best ultra trail-runners in Canada who travel the world and scale mountains competitively. They began bringing HOLOS with them wherever they went––ski vacations, camping, hiking, to races around the world––and in 2020, Sam directed and produced his first docu-film about Jeff’s attempt to set a new world record at the height of the pandemic. (You can probably guess what he fueled up on.) Today, HOLOS is deeply tied to Quebec City’s booming trail-running community, and has become a go-to breakfast for runners, cyclists, surfers, yogis, and nature fanatics around North America. In many ways, endurance sports embodies everything HOLOS stands for: the allure of pushing your physical limits, the mental rigor it requires to do so, the restorative elements of being in nature, and the power of community. It’s also an activity that, like a clean diet, can help build your endurance. This is critical for Chris, who promised himself years ago that he’d try to live to 100. In reality, he wants more than that. “I want to surf at 100. I want to climb at 100. I want to feel good,” he says. With HOLOS, you’ll find a tribe of ambitious, adventurous people hellbent on eating well and living life to the fullest. So grab a jar, feel the force, and go the distance.",

    "aboutContent": "We’re Simps Modern Beverage, a company formed in 2014 by Dave Simpson and Gerry Jobe, two bartenders who decided to take a risk and trade in the nightlife in exchange for launching our own beverage brand. Since then, we’ve created the world’s first line of Vegan Caesar Mixes, launched Canada’s first Coffee Syrups brand, and opened a retail shop in Kelowna specializing in Non-Alcoholic beverages. We are a tip-to-tail beverage company. Whether you are looking for real cane sugar syrups for coffee, cocktails, Sodastream systems and mocktails, Bag-in-Box soda concentrates and mixes for your pop gun, beverage dispensing equipment, gas to power it all or perhaps something cutting edge like the world’s first and only water soluble adaptogens, that’s what we do! Our Name: “Simps” is short for Simpson, (as everyone knows Dave locally as such) and since we were making “SIMPle SYRUPS” it was a no-brainer. “Modern Beverage” speaks for itself, but in essence, we are always pushing the boundaries of what can be created, what can be innovated and challenging ourselves to attempt what has never been done before in the world of Beverage. That’s our pocket, that’s where we live. Our Symbol: The Trident was chosen as it is belongs to Poseidon, the defender of sea life (in regards to our fish/clam free Caesar Mix) as well as in honour of our country of Canada, whose original flag featured a three-pronged Maple Leaf trident. You’re going to google that now aren’t you? Our Syrups: Most Simple Syrup is just that. Simple. 50% Water + 50% Sugar. In comparison, Simps Syrups are produced at a 5-to-1 ratio, (5 parts Sugar to 1 Part Water) resulting in what we refer to in-house as a “Rich Cane Syrup” designed to carry flavour through dilution and heat. Our syrups are pasteurized, and preserved for 365 days so if you’re a slow-sipper, don’t worry, lots of time… We’re excited to see what you create with our syrups, so don’t forget to follow us on social media and tag us in your posts. Thank you for visiting our site, taking the time to get to know us, and supporting our journey.",

    "aboutContent": "About When Ryan and his wife Kathleen were expecting their third child, Ryan would wake up, pour his 4 year old son,and 3 year old daughter a glass of milk, and watch YouTube kids videos with them.As most kids do, they LOVED watching shows about toys.Ryan loved his morning routine with the kids, but he got upset by the crazy amounts of plastic waste in the shows they watched. In one popular toy show, it almost seemed the family was promoting this waste. A kid would open a treasure chest made of plastic, wrapped in plastic, with an egg carton of plastic sitting on top. Underneath the toy was more plastic, with 20 little parts wrapped in plastic.“This is insane!” Ryan thought.Ryan wasn’t a hardcore environmentalist by any stretch, but he cared about the world and his kids’ futures. He thought “there’s got to be something we can do! This plastic is just about convenience, but what if there’s a way to make sustainable packaging convenient?” Ryan called up his good friend Brad, a serial entrepreneur. Recently Brad told him about an extended-family member with a patent on laundry detergent that was supposed to be eco-friendly, but Brad didn’t really “get it.” “If it’s so eco-friendly, how the heck does it get my clothes clean?” Brad had grown up in an eco-conscious household, but couldn’t understand how an entire jug of laundry detergent fit in packaging the size of an iPhone. But when Ryan called him up he decided to actually TRY the product for himself instead of dismissing it. Brad, Ryan, and Ryan’s childhood friend Kevin each tried the laundry strips. All three of them concluded the same thing. This stuff actually works! That’s when we decided to become a team, but first we wanted to test our idea to see if anyone else loved the laundry strips as much as we did. Kevin set up a small webpage, Ryan wrote about his experience with the product on that page, and we put it out to market. We determined that 150 subscription orders in the first 30 days would be enough to take this seriously and invest our resources into growing a company. At the end of 30 days we had 1,500 new subscribers. It became clear that just like each of us, many people want to make better consumer choices to help the environment, but simply don’t know how to. Many also feel skeptical about environmental products, but would buy them if they actually work. Because of these two desires from the people, our company was born. Within 12 months we serve 60,000 people in 40 countries... and the planet! Our Values Simplicity. We believe little hinges swing big doors and small actions add up to big changes. We’re not perfect and we’re not asking anyone else to be. Empowered: We all have the power to choose. We create products that empower people to choose sustainability, without compromising convenience.Integrity: As our organization grows we will keep the close sense of family that we started with. We will never compromise our values or cut corners to reduce costs. We will not shortchange the environment to make a profit. We will be transparent about production and ingredients. We will never shame anyone or make people feel bad about their choices, we will simply work to provide eco-friendly products that work. Meet Our 3 Co-Founders Ryan McKenzie, Co-founderI live in British Columbia with my beautiful wife and our three kids. My love for our kids and worry about their future woke up my eco conscious side. Before I co-founded Tru Earth, I had a subscription box company. I run an adventure club with Brad and Kevin that helps families around North America get off their screens and spend more time together outdoors. I believe the small decisions we make today can make a big difference for the future generations. Brad Liski, Co-founderI live in British Columbia with my two awesome kids and my loving, and ever supportive, wife. This is my 26th company and it’s the first and only one that wakes up in the morning excited to make a difference. I am leading a team of people that I can look them in the eye and say “Hey, we’re changing something, we’re not just offering people something to buy, we’re actually making a difference.” In the past decade I’ve become more awake to our current reality, and this is the only thing that has resonated with all the lessons I’ve learned as a business owner. I have one clear vision now. Kevin Hinton, Co-founderMy amazing wife and I make our home in beautiful British Columbia. We love to take our two boys up to our off-the-grid family cabin throughout the summer and appreciate nature at its finest. The need to keep our planet blue, green and full of life for future generations is never more apparent than when we are there.I’m that guy who loves all things tech and would love to help colonize Mars. In my spare time I’m working on a machine that can pull CO2 out of the air and convert it into something usable. I am obsessed with innovation that will improve our quality of life on this beautiful planet. Ryan is one of my best childhood friends. What Dave Asprey, CEO of Bulletproof Says About Tru Earth sheets “Tru Earth makes a laundry detergent that’s good for your skin and good for the environment. This is right in line with the Bulletproof philosophy. If you have to do your laundry you might as well do it in a way that saves you time and space. There are 30 billion loads of laundry done each year.If everyone switched to sheets we could eliminate 1 billion plastic jugs, and save truck fuel and CO2 equivalent to taking 27 million cars off the road a day... or planting 9 million new trees. Taking care of the environment by making small decisions that work just as well as or better than what you did before, that is how we get there. You don’t have to sacrifice for that. You’re actually going to find that you like this stuff. It’s a neat little hack. It saves time, it saves space, it’s all good!” - Dave Asprey, Bulletproof CEO",

    "aboutContent": "Dedicated To What's Real We're on a mission to craft the best tea products on the planet, combining a modern, design-forward sensibility with timeless quality. Don't be fooled by the first sip. There’s no question about it, teas with \"natural\" or artifical flavorings hit big on that first sip. They immediately activate your taste buds and trick your brain into tasting something that isn’t there. But much like chewing watermelon gum – after a few chews you don’t feel so great.Those flavorings not only contain unlisted preservative and additives but they overpower with one note, and by the end of the cup dull your taste buds.Real ingredients develop in the cup and become more complex with each sip. Teas with real ingredients leave you feeling better with each cup. BROWSE REAL TEAS We're proud to be transparent, sustainable, and crafted with care at every step. CompostablePackaging Climate NeutralCertified Carbon NeutralShipping ResponsiblySourced CertifiedOrganic Our founder story. David spent years working in the tea industry. Over time, his passion for tea grew deeper as he discovered new flavors, growing regions, or steeping methods. And he was always sharing the best teas he found with friends.One of those friends was Harley, who like many of us was finding that coffee in the afternoon made him feel jittery and impacted his sleep. So David set Harley up with some incredible green teas that gave him sustained energy in the afternoons, without any of the jitters or side effects. A new tea lover was born, and so was Firebelly. READ DAVID'S TEA STORY Whether it’s Japanese green tea to power my morning or a calming herbal tea to reset at night, tea helps me stay intentional and perform at my best.",

The Origins of Nala In 2013, we lost a vital member of our family to cancer. Alan – father, husband, friend, and mentor – whose energy was contagious and had a tendency towards larger than life ideas – was claimed by stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer. It felt too cruel and it definitely felt too soon to lose someone deserving of so much more life.Deep loss inspired deeper inquiry, and as we waded through the realities of health and wellbeing, Nala grew from an idea into a necessity. We became incapable of ignoring an issue that rattled us deep within – a value we carry forth into what Nala stands for today.We are a mother-daughter founding duo, Radmila (Mila) and Ada. Leveraging our backgrounds in biotech engineering and technology, our goals are twofold:Change the way we, as a society, view health & self care by providing high quality products free-from negative side effects.End the meaningless suffering that comes from losing loved ones too soon. \"At Nala, we want you to care for yourself in a way that keeps you around for those closest to you for a long, long time to come\" - Ada Juristovski Jemc We Stand For Nala is a natural and organic body care brand that formulates high quality, efficacious products, while encouraging deep self care. When you choose a Nala product, you can be certain you’re choosing a solution that will not damage your health. Beyond the literal, our free-from label is aspirational. It puts high-quality ingredients at the forefront, and reminds us that our deepest commitment is to create something free from the negativity and pitfalls of the current beauty industry.

    "aboutContent": "Pluck Tea was founded by Jennifer Commins in 2012 with a mission to fix restaurant tea. Today, our team of tea makers is proud to produce a wide range of hand-blended, top quality infusions for tea drinkers who value quality and sustainability - wherever they may be. Turns out, the best teas come in small batches. Our teas are made in small quantities with great care at our facility in midtown Toronto to ensure excellence in quality and freshness. Hand blending minimizes leaf damage and ensures that our makers can assess each batch and ingredient for quality, consistency, and freshness. Pluck Tea has earned GFSI / SQF Certification, a third-party audited, internationally recognized food safety standard - the highest certification possible for tea. Sustainability starts at home. Several of our favourite ingredients are grown and dried for us close to our production facility in Ontario including lavender and ginseng. This ensures that our teas are the freshest out there, while reducing our carbon footprint at the same time. We also source ingredients across Canada from farms in BC, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. Upcycling is delicious! Many of our ingredients are upcycled - which directly reduces food waste by repurposing fresh ingredients that could otherwise be diverted to compost. Pluck Tea is thrilled to be certified with the Upcycled Food Association. Examples include: Lemon and orange peels, saved and immediately dried for us by a local juice maker (who also happens to supply many of the restaurants we work with!) Cacao shells, reserved and roasted for us by a local bean-to-bar chocolatier Our zero waste glass jars are stackable, beautiful, and infinitely refillable. Let's talk tea. Tea is the original plant-based beverage. The plant itself (Camellia Sinensis) is indigenous to areas around the world that tend to be closer to the equator than Canada is. We source our tea leaves from organic and sustainable farms. Learn more about our tea sourcing practices here. Packaging matters. Our zero waste glass jars have become top sellers with tea lovers and wholesale customers alike. All teas are now available packed directly into these stackable beauties - loose or bagged. (Kraft paper resealable pouches are also available.) Thank you for supporting our small business. If you have any questions about how we make our teas, please send us a message.

Our Storywhere it all bee-ganNature Bee was founded in 2018 by Gustavson School of Business alumna Katie Gamble, guided by our motto: \"One small change has a major impact.\"What started as a tiny school project in Katie's basement has grown into a full-scale sustainability company reaching customers and wholesale markets worldwide. We began by handcrafting beeswax wraps in Victoria, BC with locally-sourced ingredients. This is a craft our passionate production team continues today. In the past few years we have expanded our product line up to include Swedish dishcloths, concentrated cleaning tablets, and innovative dish washing products. We are now proud to provide our customers with a curated collection of products for effortless sustainable living.As an inclusive, woman-owned, Canadian company, we take pride in our core values of sustainability, community, impact, and education and are committed to making the planet a cleaner place. A Message From KatieFrom my parents' basement to reaching customers worldwide - what began as a simple school project has blossomed into a thriving community where we believe that one small change has a major impact. My passion and goal for Nature Bee has always been to empower people to reduce their plastic consumption, and our progress to date has exceeded my wildest dreams. Together, we've prevented over 500,000 single-use plastics and 250,000 plastic bottles from entering landfills. What moves me most is the trust you, our community, have placed in us. When you welcome Nature Bee products into your homes, you're joining a movement toward accessible, sustainable living where small businesses drive big change. Your support has allowed us to expand from handcrafted beeswax wraps to a complete collection of sustainable home essentials.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Together, we're proving that one small change has a major impact.

    "aboutContent": "Gather ‘round friends, and hear the tale of how Awake was hatched. From the founders We’re big believers in taking the road less traveled. You must be, if you’re planning to shake up a market where the biggest brands are literally 100 years old! And that’s what we decided to do.It started in 2010 while working for PepsiCo (great company), when we saw an opportunity to solve a problem. You see, it turns out that a lot of people are looking for a pick-me-up to help them get through the day. But many don’t want to drink more coffee and refuse to try energy drinks. Why? Because they don’t like the taste. Bad taste is no fun. We thought, why not make a chocolate to deliver that pick-me-up? After all, chocolate tastes great, and great taste is fun. And why shouldn’t chocolate do more for you than just taste great? So we created AWAKE, the first functional chocolate brand. We even pitched successfully on Dragon’s Den (the Canadian Shark Tank). We risked everything and left corporate life to chase our shared dream. Truthfully, the road has been long and difficult – COVID nearly sunk our business. That hurt, a lot. But passion and optimism are a powerful combination, so we persevered and now, with the help of our amazing team (the best in the business), our brand is thriving. We’re a decade in, and things are really starting to happen!Adam, Dan & Matt Guiding Beliefs Taste is our north star We’re the only functional snack delivering on physical and emotional needs – because we put taste first. Obsess over ingredients Good enough is not part of our vocabulary. We believe that less is more, so we stick to simple ingredients that are truly delicious. Do what’s right We believe you’re never wrong to do the right thing. So, we insist on giving back to our customers, FAIR pay for our suppliers, and making responsible choices throughout our supply chain. Have fun We believe that mood matters and that smiles are contagious… so we do our level best to make our customers smile everyday. Wayne Gretzky Snowmobiling Peanut Butter Canadian, eh? Fun loving (and exceedingly polite), we’re proud to count AWAKE among the list of pretty great things to come out of the great white north.

I am the creator of Magic Oats. As a child, I grew up strictly on soy milk. My mom was severely allergic to dairy so this was all I knew. As time passed, I developed a hormonal imbalance so I decided to dig deeper on making some changes. One day, I came home from a specialty store with yet another plant-based milk I spent way too much money on only to check the label and discover fillers, oils, added sugar and stabilizers that made my gut and taste buds cringe - cue trash toss and follow it up with inspiration! Fuelling my obsession with healthy plant based food products I knew I could offer something better made with nutritious functional ingredients, that offered convenience, was easy to use and tasted undeniably more delicious. My mission is to share the most delicious better for you oat milk without compromise. ​ Founder: Lana",

    "aboutContent": "Home About Us About UsWELCOME TO DOODLE DOGS Thank you for visiting our online shop. The Doodle Dogs dream began in 2016, when a brother and sister duo had a plan to bring only the most CHIC | UNIQUE dog gear to Calgary. We discovered that the best way to build a beautifully unique pet store is to carry the beautiful handmade gear made right here in Calgary and across Canada (usually found at markets and on Etsy, etc). Here we are five years later with 20+ local brands - all handmade in Calgary and across Canada, most of which can only be bought direct from them on in our shops and our online boutique. OUR FOOD MISSION FOR YOU! - Only the Best. We do NOT carry 40 types of dry food, as we know that there are not 40 great brands. We carry specific brands that we know pass our test of greatness - so that we have full confidence you will get the best for your pup from us. Even better, we carry the best raw options on the market - as we truly believe feeding your pets fresh, unprocessed food is the WAY FORWARD, so we put a lot of emphasis on fresh option, OR helping each pet owner add fresh food to their bowl so that lifestyle and budget can be met while doing what’s possible to incorporate fresh. COREY CO-OWNER / CO-FOUNDER Corey's professionalism and ability to run a business comes from his years in oil and gas. A true pack leader, when Corey isn't helping out at Doodle Dogs, he can be found at local coffee shops, enjoying spin class, and of course cuddling his precious Staffordshire Bull Terriers Harley and Sadie. 🌈 Finnigan - Boston Terrier / Pug 2008 - 2018 🌈 Maggie - Boston Terrier (and our mascot!) 2009 - 2023 Favourite Breed: Bully Breeds MEGHAN CO-OWNER / CO-FOUNDER Meghan adores working with her clients and getting to know their furry family members. When not handing out snacks at Doodle Dogs, Meghan can be found advocating for stricter legislation around domestic animal sourcing and hanging with her pets Weechee Warrick (shih tzu) and her Persians Boop and NooNoo. Meghan enjoys spending time riding her Vespa in the summer months and traveling. 🌈 Mallzie - Persian / Himalayan 2009 - 2024 Favourite Breed: Squishy-faced fluffies Connect with Meghan on LinkedIn Our Mission: Our mission is to bring the best quality pet products and nutrition to your family. At Doodle Dogs we don't want you to have to worry about how your products were sourced, how they're manufactured or if they will be harmful for your pet. We ask the tough questions and source with integrity so you just have to show up, shop and spoil your pet. Our Food: We have a strong belief in dogs and cats' biological make up and their need for species-appropriate diets. Meat forward kibbles are what we focus on followed by air dried, freeze-dried, wet, fresh and raw. We DO NOT choose to have 200 different brands of kibble in our store to allow the best options and freshest products available. We look for brands that have integrity in their sourcing, their lack of corn and rice and foods that allow for meat to be the primary focus. At Doodle Dogs raw, cooked and fresh are what we believe are best. We believe every pet owner should have the right to choose for their family, lifestyle, and budget what they would like their pet to eat. After all, your pet doesn't have a say in the matter. Your breeder, your vet, even us aren't the be all end all for your decision making so ask questions, do your research and choose a food offering that works for you. We DO NOT stock anything made by Colgate or Nestlé as we personally do not believe their pet specialty branches focus on quality, sourcing or transparency. This does eliminate a number of large \"brand names\" that do not focus on quality products for your pets. We alternatively support, pet specialty brands making food exclusively for PETS! We do not nor will we ever sell dogs or any other animals. Customer Service is at the forefront of all that we do. If we have made an error or need to ensure your overall satisfaction we will always go above and beyond to do so. If you are out of line with us, our staff or asking for something outside of our written policies you will be asked to find another pet store to service your needs. Nods:",

    "aboutContent": "Skip to content Meet Joulian, founder of SAABOON. Discover the story behind Ottawa's vegan soap and skincare boutique, where every product is handcrafted with passion and plant-based ingredients. Handcrafted vegan soap & skincare, since 2012 Hi, I’m Joulian, the founder of SAABOON. In 2012, I started making soap in my kitchen to help with my own skin sensitivities and to create something gentle, natural, and entirely plant-based. What began as a simple experiment grew into SAABOON—a Canadian skincare brand built on ethical values, quality ingredients, and handcrafted care.From the very beginning, I’ve crafted every product myself—from soap made using the traditional cold-process method to balms, oils, and other skincare essentials—always in small batches to ensure consistency and attention to detail. As a one-person business, I handle everything from making products to packing orders and photography. SAABOON is more than my work—it’s a reflection of care, purpose, and the belief that from small beginnings, something meaningful can grow. I use only the best natural oils and don't use synthetic chemicals or foaming agents, artificial fragrance oils, artificial colourings, or any preservatives. And I am 100% against animal testing! Why buy handmade soap vs. commercial soap? The answer is very simple, with handmade soap, you get exactly that – soap. Commercial soap are not always true forms of soap – they are often detergents. Detergents are petroleum-based products, filled with synthetic, harsh chemicals that will leave your skin feeling dry, itchy, and irritated. Most manufacturers also remove a large percentage of the glycerin from their soap because glycerin contains a high resale value. The glycerin is sold to other companies to make lotions and creams. Glycerin is the natural by-product in the soap-making process. It is a humectant (helps moisturize your skin). With my handmade soap, all the glycerin is retained. Whereas with commercial soap the ingredients consists of animal fats and other chemicals that will often leave your skin irritated, my handmade soap are made with all-natural vegetable and fruit oils that not only clean, but leave your skin nourished and moisturized. Explore Your satisfaction is extremely important.My mission is to provide great quality products and excellent service. Come visit my brick and mortar shop at 595 Gladstone Avenue, Ottawa, Canada.

Each garment is produced with a commitment to best-in-class with great perceived value and excellent craftsmanship. A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TOBOGGAN For most Canadians, tobogganing is a very popular winter sport. In modern times, a toboggan is used to carry one or more people down a hill or slope for recreation. However, this tradition dates back to aboriginal times when natives would use toboggans to transport their families and supplies across snowy tundra. Toboggans were often long and narrow to fit inside a snowshoe trail and were pulled by someone wearing a chest harness or by sled dogs. The word “toboggan” is said to have originated from the word for sled by the Ml’kmaq (Tobakun). With the arrival of the Europeans, who quickly adopted the use of the toboggan, recreational tobogganing was soon born! In 1881, the Montreal tobogganing club was founded. Since then, tobogganing as a recreational past time has evolved into some serious competitive olympic racing, such as bobsledding, luging and skeleton racing.

My matriarchs are teachers, healers, bush women, social advocates, and cultural leaders. They’ve taught me how to take action and make things happen. Through my line of handcrafted soaps, I work to share the talent of my family and community.When I moved to Mayo to live in my grandmother's community on our traditional territory, I envisioned reconnecting with the people of our community, land, and culture.

The Yukon Soaps Company has allowed me to reach people in a meaningful, authentic way and empower our community.When beginning my soap making journey, it was when I came home to find local children had left baskets full of wild rose petals for my soaps that I knew I had made the right choice.

    "aboutContent": "Our BrandAt Poppy & Peonies, we believe you shouldn't have to compromise style for function. Whether your day consists of board meetings or diaper duty, our products meet you where you are. We’re passionate about designing practical pieces that help lighten life’s load – often literally – so you can navigate your busy days with ease. Founded by Natalie Dusome, a mom determined to navigate modern motherhood in style. Poppy & Peonies is a Métis female-founded, cruelty-free, Canadian accessory brand. Meet Our FounderHi I’m Nat, the founder and designer of Poppy & Peonies. Growing up in small-town Ontario, I was a little girl with a big dream: to become a fashion designer. I would drive my parents crazy-making clothes out of vintage curtains and harassing the local shop owners to carry my wire handbags as a teenager. This passion led me to design school, and after graduating, I honed my skills designing for global brands across Canada and the U.S.Then, something magical happened. My sweet daughter, Poppy, was born, and everything changed. My pre-baby accessories no longer fit my new life as a mom – I needed lots of pockets and organization. When my search for functional fashion came up empty-handed, I had a feeling I wasn’t alone. So, armed with an idea, lots of determination, and a six-month-old baby on my hip, Poppy & Peonies was born.We’ve come a long way in five years – from filling orders in my basement to appearing on Dragon’s Den, and now, expanding into new product categories and collaborating with some exciting brands. I’d be lying if I said it’s been nothing but smooth sailing, but thanks to our incredible community who inspires me every day, we have never felt more loved and supported! Thank you for supporting a little girl’s dream! SustainabilityWe believe in the Indigenous teaching of the Seventh Generation Principle to guide our sustainability practices. This philosophy tells us the decisions we make today impact seven generations ahead. We have a duty and responsibility to care for our environment and we are passionate about preserving the health and welfare of our planet, and the animals that live on it. All of our bags are made from high-quality vegan leather, and our entire product line is vegan, cruelty-free, and PETA-approved. We ship our products plastic-free and we use a combination of recycled, compostable, and biodegradable materials to mitigate shipping waste, and we are constantly looking for new ways to make our products and supply chain more sustainable to reduce our carbon footprint. Giving BackAs a mom and Métis woman, empowering, uplifting, and giving back to women and children in need is incredibly important to us, especially those in Indigenous communities. In the last twelve months we've raised over $35K for the Indian Residential School Survivors Society and continue to support Indigenous and non- Indigenous women's shelters across Canada including Mamas for Mamas with donations, product, and calls-to-action. Giving back is one of our pillars and we couldn't do it without the support of you, our incredible community. Thank you for helping us share the love! Learn More",

    "aboutContent": "Skip to content A VITAMIN REVOLUTION Have you ever seen a good idea and known in your bones that you could make it even better? Here’s how a renegade multivitamin drink mix was born, and why we strive to do better and be better every day. OUR STORY – THE LITTLE RENEGADE BRAND THAT CAN!Our little OG Ener-C team was born of a desire to do something different: we wanted to provide choice. Choice in the form of a delicious, natural multivitamin drink mix option, made with the most bioavailable, pure and sustainably sourced non-GMO vitamins and minerals and real fruit and vegetable-derived flavors and colors. We may still be a little fish in the grand scheme, but we have the energy to keep swimming upstream, powered by the belief we have something better to offer you in your quest to choose healthy and live healthy each day. SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SOMETHING BETTER.Back in 2012, we found ourselves at a crossroads. Many of us had been part of a team distributing a different Vitamin C packet product in Canada for many years, until a large pharmaceutical company bought it, and changed the landscape for us all. We were faced with a choice: do we sit back, count our blessings and let the giants rule the earth… or do we band together and choose to create something different?At the daylight end of a dark night of our entrepreneurial souls, the answer came: SOMETHING DIFFERENT. SOMETHING BETTER. WHY, YOU ASK?Because we spent ten years collaborating with some very passionate and principled people and we didn’t want to say goodbye to the relationships we built with them and the knowledge we gained along the way. Because we knew in our bones that we could create something better. Because we knew we would eventually triumph over the “knock-off brand” association by choosing the purest, most bioavailable and planet-friendly ingredients and creating a incredible and delicious-tasting, convenient and truly healthy product. And finally, because our little team discovered we are made less of “cut your losses and move on” and a whole lot more of “shimmy-up-and-try”.That’s how a renegade multivitamin drink mix was born. We are so happy to have you here with us! TESTED & TRUSTEDEnsuring Purity and Safety Making Ener-Life involves a rigorous testing process to guarantee quality and purity, including checks for the absence of any heavy metals or pesticides. We test Ener-Life’s raw materials before blending and again after the formula is mixed to ensure the highest standards. Third-Party AssuranceAll testing is carried out by independent third parties. This step is crucial to consistently meet our high standards and deliver the best possible results, ensuring that every batch of Ener-Life upholds our strict quality criteria. Certified Non-GMO IngredientsAll our ingredients and formulas are certified non-GMO by the Non-GMO Project, making Ener-Life the only vitamin mix brand to exclusively offer certified non-GMO products. We are committed to not just talking about quality and safety, but actively demonstrating it through our certifications. Meet the Fam Behind the Fizz Ener-Life is part of the Martin & Pleasance crew — a 170-year strong wellness family that believes feeling good should be simple and natural. Alongside our powerhouse siblings Vital (your daily all-in-one nutrition hero) and Schuessler Tissue Salts (the mineral support OGs), we’re here to help you feel your best, every day.

    "aboutContent": "About Us As we enter our 21st year in the candle-making journey, we’re filled with gratitude and excitement at Serendipity Soy Candles. Since 2003, we've been dedicated to crafting candles that bring warmth, joy, happiness, and serenity to homes across Canada and beyond. Each candle we create is a little spark of inspiration, lovingly made by hand and designed to evoke a sense of calm and happiness. My journey began in beautiful Nelson, British Columbia, with stops in Manitoba and Ontario before life led me to Nassau, Bahamas. It was on this enchanting island that my love for candle-making was born. Inspired by the natural beauty around me, I became passionate about creating candles that were pure, environmentally friendly, and free from any harmful ingredients.Our commitment to pure, all-natural candles deepened with my mom's cancer diagnosis. This experience opened my eyes to the hidden dangers in everyday products, and it inspired our mission: to create pollutant-free, clean-burning candles that are safe for you and your home. Though we lost my mom in 2013, her spirit continues to guide us, inspiring everything we do.Today, our journey has brought us back to Collingwood, Ontario, where we pour each candle with meticulous care. We're proud to be local and Canadian, creating products that are local, sustainable, and crafted to perfection. At Serendipity, we’re not just about production but about preserving the art of handmade craftsmanship—ensuring every candle is an expression of quality, intention, and love. Our amazing team hand pours each and every candle with care and commitment.Our all-natural, pure soy candles are made with the utmost dedication to quality, using cotton wicks and timeless scents like lavender and eucalyptus that invoke peaceful memories and provide a sense of calm and comfort in every room. These candles are created with purpose, and each one is our promise of warmth and wellness to you.As we celebrate this incredible milestone, we want to extend our heartfelt thanks to you, our wonderful customers. Your support and loyalty have been the foundation of our success.

Art has always been a huge part of my life, from my early days working with polymer and air-dry clay to my more recent explorations in painting, hand lettering, and graphic design. When I'm not creating, I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at Memorial University. Despite my tech-focused studies, my passion for creating has never faded; It has actually fueled it. I am always striving to find the perfect balance between my creative side and my technical side. This sparked the birth of my business in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown. I've been on a mission to merge my engineering skills with my artistry to produce pieces that are not only works of art but also meticulously crafted for quality and precision. Throughout my work, you will find common themes of bold colors and playful designs. My creations are more than just accessories, they're expressions of individuality and invitations for others to find pieces that resonate with their own identities. Whether you're drawn to bright colors, fun designs, or simply seeking a unique way to express yourself, I create with you in mind. Every piece I make is a labor of love, and I hope you can feel the time, effort, and passion I pour into each and every creation. Find us on socials",

A piece of clothing that carries a mission, a story, and a sense of belonging. That’s Local Laundry. Founded in 2015 by Connor Curran and Dustin Paisley, Local Laundry began not in a fashion studio, but over a conversation about what community means, and how clothing could bring people together. The lightbulb moment came, quite literally, out of a broken laundry machine and a desire to make clothing that meant something. What if our shirts, hoodies, and hats were more than just garments? What if they were a celebration of where we’re from, a tribute to who we are, and a catalyst for giving back? From that moment, Local Laundry became more than a clothing company. We make clothing that builds community. Our mission is to build a stronger Canada, one garment at a time by supporting local manufacturing, giving back to causes that matter, and celebrating the people that make this country what it is. Proudly Canadian Made. It’s not the easy path, but it’s the right one. Every purchase supports Canadian workers, fair wages, ethical labour practices, and lower environmental impact. Read more",

    "aboutContent": "In April 2016, Gabe Johnston founded Loon Kombucha in the cottage built by his grandfather in the 1960s, located on Otty Lake just south of Perth, Ontario. Knowing that almost all commercial kombucha has a harsh taste caused by hot-brewing demineralized city water, Gabe wanted this kombucha brewing company to be different, producing a pure and refreshing kombucha using high quality water and an innovative cold-brewing technique. Inspired by the purity of the Loons on the lake, who would sing as he brewed those first batches, he decided to name the kombucha brewing company after them: Loon Kombucha.With a desire to run an environmentally-friendly business, Loon was first sold exclusively in refillable bottles at local farmers’ markets in the Ottawa-Kingston area. The brand quickly developed a cult following. By June, so many grocery stores and cafes were requesting Loon Kombucha that Gabe had to move production to the Two Rivers Food Hub in Smiths Falls in order to increase capacity. Within a year, Loon outgrew the not-for-profit kitchen and made the move to Balderson, a small farming community north of Perth. This is when Loon Kombucha stopped using spring water and began brewing with Balderson's high quality, alkaline, and fully mineralized well water. Loon’s quality improved even more. The whole team knew they had accomplished something really special. Kombucha had never tasted this good.With kombucha brewing company growing and sales surging, Loon Kombucha broadened its reach and started distributing to Toronto, opened up refill stations as far as Kitchener, then expanded out as far as Collingwood and Parry Sound. Loon now ships nationally across Canada. Even though we’re expanding quickly, we still value our roots. We started as a local brand, introducing people to a kombucha inspired by the cottage country it was brewed in – pure, refreshing, and delicious. That’s what Loon will always be about.

Myni (pronounced mini). A bit in the essence of the proverb \"Small but mighty\", we want to contrast the great impact of small green actions. before everything real people doing the real work . Our Myni story Marie-Hélène David founded the company in 2020 with a goal of making safe, natural products accessible to families and the planet. The idea came to her the day she realized that her sink pipe had been corroded by the toxic fumes from her cleaning products. At that time, she undertook a journey to learn about the nature of the ingredients found in traditional cleaning products. The conclusion was clear: most cleaning products are harmful to the health of our families as well as our beautiful planet. All too often, traditional products contain carcinogenic ingredients. Also, in addition to making the consumer pay for water, transporting these liquids all over the planet has a very negative impact on CO2 emissions. What’s worse is the number of plastic bottles that are used once and then discarded. It was for this reason that Myni was born with the mission of reducing the environmental impact of the household and personal products we use, while offering a product safe for the whole family. We hope you have as much fun using our product lines as we had creating them! Marie-Helene David, Founder Since 2020 we’ve been working to create meaningful impact.

Baléco, the company behind The Unscented Company brand, was launched in November 2011 by Anie Rouleau. Her vision, right from the outset, was to offer B2B businesses a turnkey solution to reduce their plastic footprint. August 2012 Launch of OH Brand + First official sale! Our goal: Making it simple for our customers to conveniently refill from the office to their home, hence OH. Our first customers were daycares, yoga centers, offices, and schools. Quickly, our customers wanted to purchase our products from retail stores. May 2015 Officially Leaping Bunny Certified Our commitment to never test on animals was made early on in the business. We chose the well-known Leaping Bunny Certification as a seal of approval. September 2015 Officially B Corp Certified From the very beginning, B Corp values were at the heart of the company. Choosing to become B Corp Certified was a natural step in building the business with a solid foundation, enabling us to set the highest standards for the future. July 2016 Launch of The Unscented Company OH was great and allowed us to test our business concept. Secretly, The Unscented Company had always been in the back of Anie’s mind just waiting to happen. A bold name that would always ensure we remain who we are: unscented and unstoppable! February 2017 Welcome to the office, Patch! The one and only Patch officially joined the company in February 2017. And he made quite the entrance too! After 2 years of R&D, he also launched his very own Dog Shampoo Bar in 2020. June 2017 Our First National Customer OMG! Our first BIG order: The Unscented Company products were launched in 280 Bulk Barn stores across Canada. January 2019 Goop Feature Gwyneth Paltrow & The Unscented? Yes, that happened. Our products being featured on Goop in January 2019 was a stepping stone for our company and gave us quite a bit of media coverage, both locally and in the US. April 2019 Launch at Lufa Farms If you live in Montréal and love local food, you probably already know about Lufa Farms, and likely order from them. Their mission? Build a better food system. How do they do it? By building and farming on rooftop greenhouses, partnering with local farmers and food makers, and delivering baskets as quickly and efficiently as possible to the growing community of Lufavores. The perfect fit with our brand and mission; we’re proud partners! September 2019 Dragons’ Den Appearance + Launch at Canadian Tire The Unscented Company on national television! Anie Rouleau appeared on Dragons’ Den with the brand and did a refill on live TV. In collaboration with Dragons’ Den, Canadian Tire then surprised us by listing our product line in Canadian Tire stores across Canada. As Anie Rouleau said it at the time, ‘‘My business took a major shift in 15 seconds!’’ November 2019 Freshness as far as the eye can see. Launch of our TUC Body collection, our first addition to the product line since the launch of the company. Our inspiration came from the mountains, their calm, peacefulness and overwhelming feeling of well-being. The idea for the design came from a trip to Vancouver. We decided that our new products were the perfect place to pay tribute to the immense beauty of Canada’s nature with a truly inspiring packaging. We set out to create a breathtaking mountain image and reached out to Valérie Derome-Massé. She loves nature as much as we do and especially likes photographing sunrises in the fall when fog is created by the evaporation of the warm lakes. She went out to Lac Ouimet in the beautiful Laurentians with her drone and captured this amazing shot that is now on our products. December 2019 The team is growing! It’s December 2019, and The Unscented Company now has 8 employees and a loyal customer base. Our concept is proven and we’re very excited for big projects in 2020! April 2020 Dans l’œil du dragon Airing Anie is back on television, this time at Dans l’œil du dragon, the QC version of Dragons’ Den. Filmed months before, little did we know that we would have our first Zoom watch party, in the comfort of our own homes! We received a huge wave of support from across the province, and the whole team was packing orders in the warehouse! May 2020 The Unscented Company x Cirka Distilleries The beginning of the pandemic was a huge shift in priorities at The Unscented Company. The world needed soap and sanitizer, and we were on a mission to help! We teamed up with our neighbours Paul and Victoria at Cirka Distilleries to create a hand sanitizer that was Health Canada approved and made from only 3 ingredients. A unique collaboration we could have never of dreamed of, that allowed us to provide our local community with sanitizer in a time of need. The rainbow branding reminded us that ‘‘everything would be OK’’. June 2020 The all-new Smartbox! A smart cardboard box? Designed by our in-house architect and self-proclaimed box expert Manhal Alkhalil, our 10L refill box was completely redesigned to make it the coolest refill box on the market.It’s made in Canada from 100% recycled cardboard and glue-free, just like origami. It has a handle for easy transportation and, what’s more, it even has an integrated feature that tilts the bag to increase refill speed and reduce waste. It’s strong and meant to be shipped across the country, allowing more and more Canadians to refill at home and in store. Now that’s smart!

Some of our History William Ashley was launched in Toronto in 1947 by Tillie Abrams, fondly known by staff and customers alike as ‘Mrs. Ashley.’ Though Mrs. Ashley passed away in 2010, her legacy lives on. Claudia Truchan, the current President, continues the tradition and original vision of William Ashley – to bring the best selection of quality tableware and giftware to the Canadian marketplace, setting the bar as the trendsetters in the industry. At a young age, Tillie managed her family’s paint and wallpaper business while her parents attended business trips. She always took great interest in the tableware section of the family business and used her great sense of style to choose the next cutting-edge sensations in dinnerware. With her passion for quality tableware, Tillie opened her first store in Toronto’s Danforth neighborhood in 1947. At the time, it was an unusual act for a woman to own a business, yet Tillie had confidence – a true renaissance woman of her time. A few years later she chose to relocate to Bloor Street, believing it to be Toronto’s up-and-coming shopping district. As she travelled the world to source the best selection of tableware and gifts, the business continued to grow. Tillie was also revolutionary. On a visit to Chicago, she realized that Canadian stores had not yet tapped into the latest trend in the United States: the Wedding Registry. Thus, in the early 1970s, William Ashley became the very first store in Canada to offer a Wedding Registry Service. When William Ashley was located in the Manulife Centre, 55 Bloor Street West, the Great Wall of China became a cultural landmark, and was Instagram-worthy, before Instagram even existed. During the summer months, the Water Bar with its complimentary Perrier Water was a welcome place to pick up some refreshment while shopping for tableware, kitchenware or picking a Registry gift or creating a Registry. In the present Flagship store, the Colonnade - 131 Bloor Street West, customers are welcome to enjoy a complimentary coffee or Kusmi tea. William Ashley has always been at the forefront of the tabletop and home décor industry, and to this day proudly maintains the largest selection of tableware, home décor and gourmet kitchenware in the world. It is to William Ashley that the industry has always looked, because of our unique heritage and continuing legacy.

    "aboutContent": "Our storyIn 2015, Patrice Plante had one thing in mind when he founded Monsieur Cocktail: to create a syrup that would bring the cocktail world to your home. Whether as a restaurant critic, as a chef or as a barman, he’s always been driven by a boundless passion for food and drinks, the quality and origin of ingredients, and the art of creating a delicious dishes and drinks with the simple aim of putting smiles on faces.His fascination with food and travel led him on an unsuspected adventure: the world of cocktails. The cocktail allows for an incredible rapport between individuals. Contrary to food, cocktails are not a necessity. They're an excuse to socialize and to spend time with loved ones.When Patrice got behind the bar, he was surprised to see that the ingredients didn’t match the quality and standard of what was done in the kitchen. He found odd fluorescent containers of bar mix, pasteurized juices and syrups made with fructose and artificial flavors. This was not how he wanted to convey his stories and enjoyment. Quickly tired of these mass-produced, soulless ingredients, he wanted to craft simple, natural and genuine replacements. After several years of passing on his passion and making his own homemade syrups to fill the gap, he made it his mission to make mixology accessible to everyone. In 2015, Patrice founded Monsieur Cocktail with the aim of creating the world's best cocktail syrup. A syrup made with real juice and natural sugar. A syrup with no artificial flavours or preservatives. A syrup that makes a great cocktail every time, and that is available everywhere. A syrup to make it simple. To add pleasure to your drinks, whether it’s sparkling water, iced tea, coffee, lemonade or something a little more complex. Today, you’ll find Monsieur Cocktail syrups and products everywhere: at neighbourhood BBQs, at parties, at romantic evenings with a special someones and at family camping trips. Cheers!About PatriceRegular guest on Salut Bonjour! and Rouge FM, Patrice also writes a weekly column every Saturday in Le Soleil.",

    "aboutContent": "About FOUNDER & CEO, OLIVIA LOVENMARK-HAY Olivia loves creating beautiful products and memorable experiences — two things that Duchess brings together. Prior to Duchess, she was a fintech marketer working with California and New York-based startups. In 2022, Olivia co-founded Repose, a community platform that is home to the Duchess Club. She attended Kwantlen Polytechnic University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology and holds her Canadian securities designation (CSC). HOW DUCHESS COCKTAILS STARTED “In June of 2019, I was on a flight home from New York thinking that a cosmo would be great, and too bad they don’t serve those on flights. I thought, ‘someone should bottle cosmopolitans’.” Coupe Beverages Corporation was soon created and our first cocktail launched in December 2020. In 2022, we built out our own factory in East Vancouver to bring all production in-house — and Duchess Cocktails remains a self-funded, independent producer in Canada. Our cocktails offer a unique perspective; they’re not sweet, always made with real juice, and are stylishly packaged. BUT WE WEREN'T DONE INNOVATING In the fall of 2023, we launched DuchessDry to provide a real non-alcoholic experience, where taste and mouthfeel replicates that of a spirit-based cocktail, not just a juice and soda mocktail. ENJOY DUCHESS COCKTAILS Duchess Cocktails are ready-to-serve bottled cocktails, best enjoyed chilled, straight from the bottle, poured over ice, or in your favourite coupe.",

    "aboutContent": "In specialty coffee, there’s no shortage of “world’s best” roaster lists. Most of them are built on reputation, social reach, or popularity. That’s fine, but for us, the real test has always been how a coffee tastes in the cup, with no preconceived notions attached. That’s why the Global Coffee Awards caught our eye. It’s a blind competition that evaluates every coffee on a level playing field, judged purely on quality. No branding, no bias, just coffee. There aren’t many competitions like this in the world, which makes it all the more exciting. This was the first year of the event, with thousands of coffees entered from across Canada and the U.S. From that massive and talented field, we’re humbled and proud that our coffees stood out. Our Jose Joaquin Bolaños Geisha has been awarded a Gold Medal in the Filter/Washed Category at the Global Coffee Awards US & Canada, 2025! Sharing the news with Jose Joaquin was a special moment for us, marking the culmination of years of dedication, experimentation, and exceptional craftsmanship on his part. This coffee is available for a limited time, and can be found here. Our Candy Cloud Espresso, featuring Bekele Yutute Natural, also made a strong showing: • Silver Medal in Espresso – Single Origin/Experimental Processing • Silver Medal in Flat White / Alternative Milk • Finalist in Flat White / Dairy Milk We rounded out the competition with additional Finalist placements: • Espresso / Decaf – Lights Out Decaf • Filter – Single Origin / Traditional Processing – Lilac Dream, featuring coffee from the Danche (Gerba Dogo) site in Ethiopia. This recognition highlights both our team’s work and the incredible quality delivered by our producing partners. We’re thrilled with how our coffees performed.

    "aboutContent": "Canada’s Home for Comfort Since 1992 Our Story It all started in 1989, in Vancouver, Canada. Inspiration struck when our founders, Howard and Jixin, came across a simple, yet exceptional product: a well-made, well-priced duvet. From there the mission was clear: to bring better sleep to all Canadians, with high-quality, affordable bedding. And the rest is history! In 1992, they opened their first two stores as ‘Quilts Etc’ in Clearbrook and Nanaimo, BC. Over three decades later, QE Home has evolved from a small family business into a Canadian household name. Though we’ve done some growing up, we’ve stayed true to our roots, putting family, comfort, and our communities first. Today, we have over 70 stores across the country, from Vancouver Island to the tip of Newfoundland. Whatever your style and however you sleep, our team of in-house designers and experts are dedicated to creating products you’ll love — using sustainable, high-quality materials that offer deeper, healthier sleep. No middlemen, no markups, just quality linens. Our Goal Your best days start with better sleep. When you wake up rested and rejuvenated, cocooned in soft linens, wrapped in a warm, cloud-like duvet — there’s no better way to greet the day. Your bedroom is a personal sanctuary—it should reflect who you are, from style to comfort. At QE Home, our goal is to help you create a space that celebrates your unique take on the world — that makes you feel both comfortable and at home. How do we do it? With thoughtfully designed bedding and accessories that bring healthy, natural comfort and unique design to every home — and every budget. Our Evolution Howard and Jixin come up with the name 'Quilts Etc' and open their first two stores in Clearbrook and Nanaimo, BC. Though cobbled together with second-hand fixtures and holding little product, Quilts Etc draws a crowd. Our founders are on the right track. The digital boom is in full swing, and we get our very first website! The early 90s were a time of rapid growth. Now, the family business spans the nation, with stores in Calgary, Alberta to Mississauga, Ontario. We bring in our first line of eco-friendly textiles, made of ultra-soft, natural bamboo fibres. Thinking ahead, we launch version one of our e-commerce site. For the first time ever, our products are available for purchase online! We begin building out our in-house design team and creating whole new lines of bedding every season. We rebrand! Quilts Etc becomes QE Home. \"QE\" as a nod to our past. \"Home\" to better represent the variety of products we offer and carry us into the future. We face a year unlike any other. To succeed, we focus on offering new services to our customers with safety in mind, like same day pick up. With over 70 brick-and-mortar stores and a well-established e-commerce site, we're proud to serve Canadians across the country. We hope we can help you find comfort for years to come! As a child, I used to spend time in our stores with my dad. What I remember most was the way we made people feel. The joy when guests walked out of our store with fresh linens, and the gratitude people expressed for the comfort we provided. The way I see it, QE Home doesn't just provide bedding. We provide well-being, delight, and memories for Canadians of all ages and generations. - Christina Xu, COO Our Approach Expertise We've got over 30 years of experience specializing in bedding, perfecting comfort, and elevating your sleep.

As a professional wine sommelier and service leader, it was my dream to own a successful restaurant one day.That journey required long hours, sleepless nights, working nights, weekends and holidays.At the time I was surviving off of 5-6 cups of coffee a day which did little to help my already existing anxiety, insomnia, digestion and sleep challenges.I knew I couldn’t keep up at the pace forever, but I wasn’t going to give up. I had to learn new ways to take care of myself so that I could reach my full potential and continue building a career and life that I loved.That's when I was introduced to tea. I found rooibos for sleep,maté for energy, botanicals like moringa to calm my nerves,matcha to give me a boost of antioxidants to keep colds at bay, the list goes on. Each blend I discovered felt like a piece of a puzzle to building my ultimate life.I began sharing my experience, and formulating my own blends with herbs and ingredients that would further enhance the results of the base blend. It was during this time, I became a certified tea sommelier, falling in love with the intersection of functionality & science between tea and botantics.I’m still that same ambitious person I was when I started my career in hospitality, and I want you to have the tools that I found to reach their full potential.

With boutiques in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, and Ottawa, our story begins in our light-filled Vancouver atelier, where every gown is designed and handmade. We round out our boutiques with accessories made in-house and sourced from independent, women-owned makers. We celebrate individual style. We put the comfort and confidence of our brides first. And we believe wedding dress shopping should be fun. It’s so good to meet you. Our Brands In 2013, Gaby Bayona founded Truvelle, a bridal line that has since grown into one of Canada’s most beloved names. LAUDAE followed in 2016, bringing a modern edge to Truvelle’s romance, and in 2019 came Aesling, defined by clean lines and architectural simplicity. What began as a solo venture in Gaby’s apartment has, collectively, grown into one of Canada’s largest bridal companies — and one of the few remaining fashion houses that still creates everything in Vancouver. In our 8,500-square-foot atelier, a talented team of cutters, sewers, and checkers bring each gown to life. Through it all, our ethos has stayed the same: bride first, quality first, design first — always. Say Hi We’re not just here to sell you a wedding dress — we’re here to get to know you and celebrate finding \"the one\".

    "aboutContent": "About Eight Ounce Coffee Eight Ounce Coffee is a company of coffee people passionate about specialty coffee and all the fun gear and equipment that go with it. We started in 2011, mostly selling AeroPress and KeepCups to an emerging crowd of specialty coffee baristas and home coffee enthusiasts. As the market grew, we expanded our line of products considerably. We soon realised that it was difficult for Canadian cafes and roasters to bring in the high end specialty coffee brands that were so easy to get in larger countries. Buying smaller amounts and paying for freight and import made it not worthwhile for them. By bringing in large volume amounts of great quality coffee gear and taking care of the import and logistics, we made it possible to get the best coffee brands into Canadian hands. We're very picky about the brands we sell. We only sell the best quality product in every category - never selling knock-offs or imitations. We support those who innovate, not those who copy. We're now the biggest specialty coffee equipment distributor in Canada, selling to almost four thousand cafes, roasters, hotels, kitchen and lifestyle stores across the country and in America. We also distribute to some of the biggest and best names in specialty coffee around the world. We operate out of a thirty thousand square foot warehouse in Calgary, with team members in Calgary, Montreal and Toronto. We're a huge part of the growing specialty coffee scene in Canada - we help organise and sponsor barista competitions, AeroPress competitions, Brewers Cup and Cup Tasters, and are co-founders of the Prairie Coffee Collective. Nothing makes us more excited than the anticipation of a new cafe opening. We love the community of coffee in Canada - and wouldn't be where we are today without it.

Additionally, she completed an internship with Estonian jewellery artist and MA professor Tanel Veenre (Tallinn). Her artist jewellery has been exhibited nationally and internationally in juried shows.Currently, she is owner and designer of “Chayle Jewellery Studio”, established 2013 in Ottawa. Ethics & SustainabilityOur PhilosophyWith a sense of minimalist elegance and ethical vision, Chayle Jewellery is handcrafted in Ottawa, Canada, using only recycled and conflict-free sources of gold and silver, ethically sourced gemstones, and Canadian diamonds. Learn More Made with loveOur StudioEach piece of jewellery produced by Chayle Jewellery, goes through our studio with care and attention to detail. We choose to use a selection of traditional goldsmithing techniques, combined with new technologies like 3D printing, to create a balance between handmade aesthetics and contemporary precision. Artist StatementMy work as an artist goldsmith combines my passions for traditional metalsmithing and minimalist design. I use hammering techniques to create jewellery which flows naturally with the body. The shapes I use are often bold, capturing the negative spaces and contours of the body. For me, it is important to consider the wearer within the design process of my pieces. I enjoy the challenge of creating beauty and elegance while maintaining wearability and sentimentality. With my material choices of precious metals, colourful patinas, and rustic hammer textures, I hope to capture a feelings of ancient jewellery and the romantic notion of a genuine handmade treasure. My current work seeks to create a playful dialogue between traditional and contemporary jewellery, and has become a driving force for my curiosity and creativity as an artistic goldsmith. ~ Chayle Bowen ottawa style magazine\"Elegant meets Edgy jewellery\" “Capturing the simplicity and modern elegance of hammered precious metals.” Design Inspiration\"Influenced by the negative spaces between branches, and the curling and overlapping growth of lichen, I am interested in the geometric qualities and structured chaos within these natural forms. My work in jewellery, uses colour, contour, and layering to emphasize these types of forms and spaces.\"\"Edges and shadows describe, contain, and shape the spaces in my work-- revealing the spaces and the structures that hold them as the subject matter of my work.\"\"The forms and aesthetic in my work are derived from natural inspirations. I have worked to distill the elements of natural forms, searching for the chaotic happenstance of their growth patterns. My current work has become a playful exploration of these form and geometry.\" SHOWROOM & MEETINGSOur OfficeFilled with natural light, cozy seating, and a cafe, our office is a perfect spot for us to meet with our clients to discuss custom jewellery designs, show samples and gemstones, and for our clients to pickup their finished jewellery.

    "aboutContent": "Dean Davidson jewelry is constructed with just as much passion and attention to detail as it’s conceptualized. Every piece is meticulously handcrafted and made from the highest quality materials, with a warranty that promises a lifetime of wear. Celebrate every unique corner of the world with DD, where style has no limits and jewelry is always one-of-a-kind. ABOUT DEAN Creating timeless jewelry with a global perspective, Dean Davidson is known for careful craftsmanship, hand-cut gemstones, and a signature brushed finish. Rooted in Canada and inspired by world travels, the brand’s story is as remarkable as the designs themselves.Dean spent his early life on Canada’s vast farmland, surrounded by natural beauty and gifted the freedom to explore. Straying from the norm to follow his innate creativity and knack for entrepreneurship, Dean shifted from a career in agriculture to founding his own jewelry brand. This choice would lead him to travel the globe and adorn prominent figures in his designs.Travel is at the very heart of the Dean Davidson brand -- Balinese basket weaving, the bamboo forest of Kyoto, and Brazil’s otherworldly sand dunes have all served as inspiration, resulting in pieces that encapsulate the wonder gained from Dean's experiences. BEHIND THE ART Dean Davidson jewelry is designed in our Toronto studio. Every piece is hand-sketched in-house and sampled to perfect each design, producing iconic, signature features. Dean partnered with a family-owned workshop of artisans early on in the brand’s foundation. Located in Jaipur, India, a global hub for jewelry manufacturing, the multigenerational workshop specializes in fine jewelry and has created jewelry for the royal family of Jaipur. They cut every gemstone by hand according to Dean’s original designs, marrying time-honored tradition with forward-thinking aesthetics. “What sets us apart is our dedication to creating timeless, classic pieces that transcend trends and age.” - Dean Davidson, CEO + Creative Director SHOP DEAN'S PICKS Plaza Ring Plaza Ring Tiger's Eye $300.00 CAD 375.00 20% OFF 13 colours available Mara Hinged Bangle Mara Hinged Bangle $260.00 CAD Mara Hinged Cuff Mara Hinged Cuff $350.00 CAD 2 colours available Mara Ring Mara Ring $185.00 CAD 2 colours available DOUBLE-SIDED Ipanema Pendant Ipanema Pendant Tiger's Eye $316.00 CAD 395.00 20% OFF 3 colours available Nairobi Statement Chain Nairobi Statement Chain $375.00 CAD 2 colours available View Collection EXPLORE MORE",

She deferred her archeological studies to enroll in a jewellery arts programme where she acquired her formal goldsmithing skills. Anne founded her brand with the opening of her first atelier in the late 1980’s. This was the beginning of a prolific career which continues to evolve. Carrying on the legacy Meet Haley For her daughter Haley, jewellery has been a lifelong inspiration, nurtured by her mother's creativity. Surrounded by the beauty and passion that defined Anne's collections, Haley found herself drawn into the world of fine jewellery by working in the retail store and at trade shows. She admired her mother's craftsmanship and the stories woven into each piece, sparking a curiosity and deepening her interest in the business.Anne entrusted Haley with more responsibilities working with clients for bespoke jewellery including the cherished task of crafting one-of-a-kind engagement rings, a testament to Haley's growing expertise and commitment to excellence.

    "aboutContent": "Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. From Denmark to Canada The Pilgrim Journey Pilgrim began in 1983 at the heart of Denmark’s vibrant festival scene. Founder Annemette Markvad, driven by her love for art, music, and human connection, created handmade jewelry that reflected her passion for storytelling. Festivals became her canvas—a space to share not just her designs but meaningful exchanges, weaving bonds with every piece sold.What started as a small, heartfelt endeavor quickly grew into something extraordinary. Pilgrim's designs, rooted in Danish minimalism and crafted with care, resonated with people seeking pieces that carried personal meaning. Today, Pilgrim has evolved into a global brand, celebrated for its craftsmanship, authenticity, and commitment to empowering individuality—all while staying true to the values that began under festival skies.The next chapter for Pilgrim began in 2014, when Robert P. Hayes, a Canadian with Gaspésien roots and an upbringing in Ottawa, encountered the brand during his time in Denmark. Inspired by its design and meaningful approach to craftsmanship, Robert brought Pilgrim to Canada, establishing a connection between Danish artistry and Canadian sensibilities. What Makes Pilgrim Extraordinary At Pilgrim, we believe in the extraordinary power of storytelling and craftsmanship. Every collection we create is a testament to artistry and meaning, drawing inspiration from Nordic landscapes, vibrant urban culture, and rich folklore. These influences breathe life into our designs, making each piece more than jewelry—it’s a symbol of connection and expression.The journey of each design begins with a spark of inspiration, evolving through thoughtful sketches and meticulous handcrafting.

    "aboutContent": "Our Story: Jewelry That Lives Life With You At Pearlory, we craft beautiful, durable jewelry designed to complement every aspect of daily life. We believe high-quality, beautiful jewelry should be accessible without the excessive markups. Like many, we were frustrated with jewelry that couldn’t keep up—favorites that tarnished, faded, or broke from constant wear, and pieces that were too precious to risk wearing every day. Now you can say goodbye to care instructions—our pieces are designed to be worn everywhere. In the shower, at the gym, at the office, by the pool, and even while sleeping. Built to last through every moment, each piece is hypoallergenic, waterproof, sweatproof, and cosmetic-friendly. Our mission is simple: worry-free jewelry for every moment. We are a Canadian-owned business, with fulfillment centres in both Canada and the U.S. to help our customers avoid fees and duties. Made to Last, Made for You We’ve taken inspiration from the durability techniques of Swiss watchmakers to create jewelry that lasts. Using advanced PVD real-gold plating—the same process trusted by luxury brands like Chanel—we make highly resilient pieces that won’t fade or lose color. Pearlory’s PVD real-gold plating ensures longevity without compromising our planet’s health. Our jewelry is crafted from hypoallergenic, medical-grade stainless steel, so you can say goodbye to rust, tarnish, and irritation. Unlike other brands that rely on copper or brass, Pearlory’s stainless steel is as sweatproof as it is rust-resistant, designed to be worn every day, everywhere. Our mission is simple: to bring you affordable, long-lasting jewelry you can rely on, whatever your style or budget. THE BASE Instead of cheap, corruptible metals like copper and brass that corrode and tarnish, we use premium, hypoallergenic, 100% recyclable stainless steel—extremely resistant to moisture, chemicals, and heat. THE COATING Crafted with an eco-friendly PVD gold plating process trusted by renowned brands like Rolex and Chanel—our jewelry is made to last. The result? Hypoallergenic, fade-resistant, waterproof, and sweatproof pieces you can rely on every day. THE COMMITMENT Our plating process avoids harmful chemicals, reduces water use, and minimizes waste. By focusing on durable, hypoallergenic materials and eco-conscious packaging, we’re helping to break the cycle of fast fashion with jewelry that’s gentle on the planet and made to last. Shop Now",

Whether it's a quiet reminder of strength or a celebration of who you are, our designs are made to be worn with meaning.

Proudly Canadian and independently owned, Suetables is a testament to the creative spirit of women in business. We are here for the storytellers, the seekers and those who embrace life on their own terms. From small wins to big moments, your jewelry should reflect you. Our Founder Suetables began in 2005 as a passion project by founder + CEO Sue Henderson, a stay-at-home mom looking for a creative and meaningful outlet. What started as hand-stamping words onto vintage spoons for baby gifts soon evolved into something more personal—etching her sons' initials onto pendants to keep them close to her heart. As friends began requesting their own personalized pieces, the vision grew. From simple hand-stamped charms to a full jewelry line, Suetables was built on the idea of using words and symbols to tell stories and express personal truths. Today, Suetables has grown from a home-based business into a thriving retail brand with multiple storefronts and a global e-commerce presence. Suetables have been worn by icons like Meghan Sussex and are featured in FASHION, Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar and People Magazine. While the brand has expanded, our mission remains the same: to create quality jewelry that helps people share their stories and carry meaning in a beautiful, wearable form.",

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Megan Mackenzie Jones was born an artist. There was never a doubt, even from a young age, that she would imagine her own path and follow her creative spirit. In her formative years she travelled across Canada and fell in love with every corner of our nation. Her creative spirit led her to attend the Alberta College of Art + Design and major in Jewellery + Metals where she graduated with honours. Inspired by Canadian flora and fauna, Megan was set on a path to start her own business after graduation. While working as a landscaper Megan balanced work and creativity. Slowly growing her tools and studio into a small workspace in the basement. Hard work and the great out doors have been two constants no matter where life takes her. While playing around in the studio, Megan made the first mountain ring. Inspired by the need to capture that feeling of home, and to carry it with you always. This changed the trajectory and everything started to fall into place. The first Mountain Maid came to be. Megan fulfilled her dream of having a full in house casting studio, by building it from the ground up. The studio became a safe haven and made room to expand the team. We call it our little slice of heaven, complete with everything one needs to create. Growing the team was our biggest adventure. Sharing in passions, dreams and creativity has been one of the most fulfilling parts of Mackenzie Jones. One can always be inspired when surrounded by such powerful and beautiful souls. Mackenzie Jones has grown through an amazingly supportive community. This has allowed us to follow our dreams and to give back to the community. We pride ourselves in fostering positive progress within ourselves, our business and our community.",

No gatekeeping, no hype, just performance fuel you’ll actually use. Omega-3 Without the CatchOur omega-3 supplements come from algae, not fish—because protecting your brain shouldn’t mean overfishing our oceans. Good for your body. Better for marine life.

A Letter From Our Co-FounderTo the adventurers, explorers and athletes out there who want to help save the planet but feel hopeless or powerless: We hear you because we are you.Reflecting on the past few years living with my family in a mountain town in British Columbia, we've seen heat records broken, friends houses lost to forest fires, and are wrapping up a winter season with historically low snowpack. With mountain bike season approaching, we are anticipating another tough summer. It has been weird to say the least. Is this the future I want for my 2-year old son? Not at all. I never thought that I'd have to tell him that we can't go outside today because the smoke is too bad but this seems to be what people are calling the \"new normal\".Is there hope? It is hard to feel hopeful when it seems like us humans can't even agree on \"Is climate change real?\" Here's the thing. I know that you care (you've read this far!) and I know that I care so we're not alone in our concern for the future. Let's take action and make what seems impossible possible. Can we stop what’s coming? Hopefully. If you and I and all our friends who give a shit work together — like actually work together on these hard things — I believe we can protect the places and activities we love. Freshfield is here to help you and I do the fun stuff and the hard stuff: Adventure, explore and perform while radically lowering our impact on the planet for the sake of future generations.Michael Mazur, Co-founder (March 25, 2024) Supplements May 26, 2025 0 comments Plant-based, Fish-Free Omegas, Two Ways: Which Softgel Fits Your Life?

The Cudmore family has been in retail for 111 years! Originally from Prince Edward Island, the family business began with Thomas Roy Cudmore, Chelsea's great grandfather, as a Haberdashery and followed with her grandfather, Brian. The business continued with Chelsea’s parents,Chris and Beryl Cudmore, who pivoted to resort retail in 2001. Now Chelsea, and her brother Devon lead the family business.

Make this a stop while you shop Banff. Local love, owned and operated by a young local family who have done a great job in serving the needs and must have for residents and visitors.Nancy DaDalt This is an incredibly cute store! After shopping around in downtown Banff you quickly realize a lot of the stores sell the exact same items so shopping gets boring really fast. However, this store sells very cute products. They have awesome designs on their shirts and sweaters and they’re very soft and comfy to wear. They come in preshrunk cotton so you don’t have to worry about buying a size up either. This store is also dog friendly so feel free to bring your pups in. While browsing I encourage you to check out their fitting room. The hanging chair is so fun. They also have great mugs and dish towels, along with notebooks and other accessories.One impressive thing to note is how the employees stock the store. Everything is meticulously folded and organized from xsmall to xlarge. You will definitely leave with something when you come here.Trucchi Retail Council of Canada 2023 Excellence Awards FinalistWe're proud finalists of the Retail Council of Canada 2023 Excellence Awards for In-Store Experience & Design.",

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Hi there! My name is Magan, I am the owner, founder and creator behind Milk and Memories. Thank you so much for visiting our website! We would love for you to join our community on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok! Who are we?I am a wife to an amazing husband and father, we have two beautiful children. I have always been a bit of an entrepreneur, I’ve dabbled in a few small businesses and finally found my love in creating. I have had a successful crafting business since 2017. I am also an Educational Assistant with my local school board. When I am not working I can be found enjoying time with my family creating as many memories as possible. How it all startedAs most breastfeeding mothers my journey was a rollercoaster of emotions. With my son I had goals of exclusively pumping for a year. It was a lot of work and unfortunately, I ended up losing my supply when he was 3 months old. When I had my daughter, we were able to latch! I was determined to make it much longer. We powered through mastitis more than once, low supply, and other hurdles along the way. We made it to two years of breastfeeding! When it was time for her to wean it was such an emotional struggle for me to stop. I heard of breastmilk jewelry and new I wanted a piece made one day to commemorate this empowering and emotional chapter. I kept a bottle in my freezer for when I could afford to buy the perfect ring.Four years after my breastfeeding journey ended my husband decided that he was going to surprise me with a breastmilk ring. Unfortunately for him the plans fell through. Luckily, for me I have been a crafty person with a successful crafting business for the past 5 years and his thoughtfulness set the plans in motion for my researching how to make my perfect ring! After some extensive research I finished my ring, and it was more beautiful than I had imagined! I then got to work on making myself and my family a few beautiful memorial pieces. I decided to offer these special keepsakes to others as I just cannot keep these meaningful pieces to myself. What we doHere at Milk and Memories we help you to preserve your precious memories by encasing them into beautiful jewelry pieces. We use a variety of inclusions from breastmilk to ashes and so much more in between. Let me help you create your special keepsake, I promise to treat your inclusions with the highest of respect and love while creating your piece and in the packaging of your completed keepsake.

Our lives had been forever altered and we dreamed of being able to once again live lives we could love. When our family was invited to Canada, our dreams came true. REBUILDING With the support of our new community of Antigonish and the people of Nova Scotia, we have rebuilt our chocolate company and are once again doing the work we love. Since Peace By Chocolate was founded at the beginning of 2016, we have been fortunate to share our passion for chocolate with new friends in our community of Antigonish, with people all across the province of Nova Scotia, and now around the world. PEACE BY CHOCOLATE TODAY Our desire for excellence is apparent in every piece of chocolate we produce. We passionately combine a blend of Syrian fillings and ingredients, including nuts, fruit, and spices, creating a little taste of heaven in every sweet.Inside each Peace By Chocolate product is uncompromising quality, with each chocolate a little work of art in and of itself, exuding sophistication, style and excellence. We encourage you to try our chocolate soon because, after all, One Peace Won't Hurt™.

    "aboutContent": "About A Sweet Family Tradition Handcrafting the finest chocolates and confections since 1959 Creating Memories Since 1959 At Mordens’ of Winnipeg, we are passionate about providing top quality, delicious products to our customers. As a family-owned and operated business, we pride ourselves in selecting premium ingredients and producing the finest chocolates and confections. We would like to thank all of our loyal customers for making Mordens’ of Winnipeg a family tradition for 60 years and counting. Timeline 1959 Mordens’ of Winnipeg opened its doors in 1959, when Blake and Shirley Morden founded Winnipeg’s first chocolate-making business. With a little training, a lot of hard work and endless determination, Blake and Shirley built Mordens’ into a beloved confectionary destination. In the early days, the entire Morden family worked side by side to build the business. Blake and Shirley were supported immensely by Blake’s parents, Fred Sr. and Lily. Blake and Shirley’s children, Cara, Shannon, and Fred, joined the family business as soon as they were old enough to fold a peanut brittle box. 1984 The Mordens’ passion for quality drove them to innovate. In 1984, Mordens’ Signature Russian Mints won top prize for Best Chocolate Piece at the World Fair in New Orleans. The Mordens’ were among the first candy manufacturers to produce chocolate covered jujubes and chocolate covered ginger, both of which are customer favourites to this day. 2007 Mordens’ of Winnipeg won the Excellence Award by the North American Packaging Association for the superior design, uniqueness and functionality of their cube box packaging. 2019 Mordens’ of Winnipeg celebrated their 60th anniversary and won Company of the Year for Industry Excellence by Food and Beverage Manitoba. Today Four generations later, the innovation and passion for quality continues. The Morden family now produces over 70 varieties of chocolates, confections and nuts.",

    "aboutContent": "About Lustre Lustre is an atelier in Montreal QC, established in 2006. Yasmine Wasfy, designer and founder, creates her clothes with a focus on body positivity, size inclusivity, sustainability, and ethical practices. Lustre provides custom garment creation for brides and wedding parties (mother of the bride, mother of the groom, bridesmaids, wedding guests), evening and event wear, cocktail dresses, loungewear, tops, pants, skirts, and jumpsuits. Whether you’re looking for something to wear every day (at home or the office) or to a special event, Lustre offers well-tailored and fabulous fitting clothes. A small and intimate company, Lustre has a team of eight people. On the clothes-creation side, you have Yasmine, the designer; Alex, studio assistant (Yasmine’s right-hand-person for 13 years, give or take); Hy, a sewer (who’s been with us for 10 years); Christina, a sewer; and Chiakoun, our newest member and second studio assistant. On the online-creation side, there is Rin, the photographer; Jess, the makeup and hair artist and artistic visionary for the front window installations; Katherine, the copywriter, website designer, and head of outreach. (Want to know more about our stellar team? Click here!) We also have three part-time workers for extra support when we need it. Just because we’re small doesn’t mean we’re not mighty, and the quality of our output speaks volumes about the skills, work ethic, and passion of every person on the team. Everything Lustre is made here in Montreal by people earning a living wage. In looking through our photos, you might notice the veritable variety of bodies. We want people of all shapes, colours, and abilities to feel good in our clothes. Body-positivity and size-inclusivity are pillars of Lustre designs. Standard sizing in fashion excludes many, and Lustre always strives to be an open, welcoming, and safe space for one and all. Ready-to-wear items are made in a wide range of sizes, while we will always work with you to create a custom-fit piece. Yasmine has built her size chart based on years of experience with real people tailoring to her clients. Please take a look at our size chart and measurements for a clear idea of what off-the-rack sizes are available. Custom options and tailoring are always available if the size chart doesn’t speak to you.",

A shirt that didn’t compromise on quality, price, or the integrity of the people who made it. Today, we’re a certified B Corporation voted Best for the World™, with the fourth-highest B Impact Score of apparel brands in North America. With each order, we invest in the creation of jobs, infrastructure, systems, and education to alleviate poverty and create shared, sustainable growth for the communities we are part of.Video by Adrian AssoufiThe idea for Kotn was dreamt up during a hot New York summer by three friends, our Co-founders, Ben, Mackenzie, and Rami. Spurred on by the thought, Rami took a trip back to his familial home of Egypt where he found himself living in a cotton-farming community in the Nile Delta for six months. There, the first real seed of Kotn was planted.",

    "aboutContent": "Our story No washes. No distressing. Just raw denim from Japan, cut and sewn in Canada, built to last — and fade on your terms. vision We're a bit obsessed with denim—okay, maybe a lot obsessed. But that's because we are committed to sourcing and crafting only the most unique and exceptional denim fabrics from prestigious Japanese mills. These mills aren’t just fancy—they’re legendary. They blend old-school heritage with modern methods and practices. So much culture and history is poured into the fabric so that it can be appreciated by the denim purist. Our approach is straightforward: we keep denim raw, authentic, and free from unnecessary embellishments or treatments. That means no pre-distressing, no flashy embroidery, and no fancy washes. We skip the celebrity endorsements and expensive ad campaigns, investing instead in quality fabrics and precise construction to deliver the best denim at accessible prices. And here’s something we’re super proud of: every single pair of our jeans is cut, sewn, and finished right here in Canada. Always have been, always will be. That's the gist, but if you're curious to know more about our journey, our roots, and what makes us tick—keep reading. We are not a normal denim brand And we never will be. We develop crazy things and fabrics no one asked for — but everyone talks about. Cut, made, and sewn in Canada. Our history2008: LAUNCHWe launched to challenge the premium denim industry—no celebrities, no gimmicks, no washes. Just the world’s best Japanese selvedge, made in Canada, and priced honestly. Brandon Svarc, a third-generation garment maker from Montréal, set the tone: obsessive about fabric, allergic to nonsense, and ready to have fun. Our history2011: First StoreWe launched our first store, Tate + Yoko, right here in Montreal—where the garment industry shaped the city and our roots run deep. Our head office stands in the heart of what was once the needle trade’s core. While most of the industry faded, we stayed. Every product is still made in Canada, and this space lets us share the full Naked & Famous Denim lineup alongside other brands we admire. Our history2012: World RecordWe launched the 32oz Super Heavyweight denim—the heaviest jeans ever produced at the time. Woven in Okayama, Japan, on vintage shuttle looms, this denim used yarns as thick as those found in carpets or sailboat sails. The production was so demanding that only two pairs could be made per day, each requiring the skill of three machine operators. Brandon Svarc, joked, “Guaranteed uncomfortable or your money back.” Our history2015: NIPPON BLOOMIn 2015 Naked & Famous Denim launched the Made in Japan series and with it a new logo. This logo dubbed “Flower of Carnage” is a Japanese Manga-esque rendition of the original Naked & Famous Denim “Tragic Blond” pop art logo. Our history2018: Hello SohoWe needed a U.S. home that could carry everything we make—every fit, fabric, and experiment—and SoHo was the obvious choice: high traffic, denim-literate customers, and global visibility. We built our New-York City flagship store our way, with Japanese raw denim floor tiles that fade underfoot, indigo-dyed counters, and boro-lined change rooms. There’s even a secret door behind antique Kokeshi dolls. Our history2025: HEAVIEST EVERFrom the start, we’ve chased heavyweight denim—18oz, 19oz, 21oz, 24oz, 26oz—culminating in our 32oz record-breaker. When others went heavier, we went all in: the 40oz Super Heavyweight Selvedge. Woven in Okayama on modified shuttle looms, it was so dense it took multiple operators days to sew one pair. Finished with 30oz cowhide patches, elk sinew stitching, copper rivets, and WALDES zippers. OriginsNaked & Famous Denim - Why though?

We wash our sheets and duvet cover every week (with bleach!), and if you’re seeing crisp, smooth, and clean sheets on my Instagram feed there is a high likelihood I used a little app called FaceTune to get rid of those muddy paw prints 😉 What was your experience like on The Bachelor & The Bachelorette?

    "aboutContent": "Our Story Douglas: the Mattress Made for Canadians Canada First In 2009, we launched what would become Canada’s largest independent online mattress company. GoodMorning.com is a company of firsts: the first 100+ night trial; the first online luxury mattress brand in North America; the first to offer 100% free returns; and the first to offer zip-in adjustable firmness. We’ve seen many competitors come and go, most of them designing their products for the USA and treating Canada as an afterthought. With Douglas, we decided to put our focus on Canadian sleepers first and foremost. Douglas has been designed, crafted, and tested for Canadians from the beginning. Based in Western Canada, our co-founder, Sam Prochazka, spent many months combining the best high-performance foams and textiles from Canada’s top manufacturers, and the results are breathtaking: we have created one of Canada’s best sleep products for a simply unbeatable price.

Frequently Asked Questions Guides Comparisons Contact About Us We live to design elegant solutions to hard problems and, by doing so, to improve people's lives in clear ways. Sam Prochazka Founder & CEO, GoodMorning.com A new idea. Buying a mattress had become one of the most confusing, time consuming, and frustrating experiences. Sam and his team spent more than a year designing a single high-end mattress, techniques to ship it efficiently, and invented the concept of a 120-night risk free trial. In 2009, he launched Novosbed to be the first totally risk-free mattress buying experience. Novosbed Today Today, Novosbed has grown from a single premium mattress brand into GoodMorning.com, an online collection of highly rated sleep products. We continue to deliver thousands of mattresses across North America each year. Our Toronto-based manufacturing partners help us produce and deliver mattresses to our Canadian customers while our US-based facilities allow us to serve our American clientele. Every day we work with dozens of engineering, manufacturing, and logistics partners across the continent to make buying, receiving, and owning a mattress easier than ever. But we don't stand still. At our core, we are designers and inventors who exist to find elegant solutions to hard problems. What is Novosbed? Great product, for less We don't cut corners to cut the price. We strive to provide a quality product at a lower price. Customer care We aim to deliver spectacular service to our customers from the moment they order and well beyond. Lower eco impact We strive to keep our mattresses out of landfills and we never use harmful materials or chemicals. Donating mattresses to those less fortunate. Before Novosbed, most companies sent returned mattresses to land-fills, or would re-sell them. We decided to think differently about returns. We built a national network of charitable organizations, moving companies, and logistics partners to make returns not only incredibly easy, but also to put returned products into the hands of less fortunate people. Since our founding in 2009, we have given thousands of mattresses to people who need them, diverting mountains of waste from landfill, and have watched our practice become the new standard in the industry.
